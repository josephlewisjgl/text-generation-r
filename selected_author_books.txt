"CONTENTS"
" Epilogue"
"The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was"
"expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and"
"twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire"
"burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the"
"lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our"
"glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather"
"than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious"
"after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the"
"trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the"
"points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his"
"earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity."
"“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two"
"ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,"
"they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”"
"“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said"
"Filby, an argumentative person with red hair."
"“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground"
"for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of"
"course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real"
"existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane."
"These things are mere abstractions.”"
"“That is all right,” said the Psychologist."
"“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a"
"real existence.”"
"“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All"
"real things—”"
"“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube"
"exist?”"
"“Don’t follow you,” said Filby."
"“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real"
"existence?”"
"Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any"
"real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have"
"Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural"
"infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we"
"incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three"
"which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,"
"however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former"
"three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our"
"consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter"
"from the beginning to the end of our lives.”"
"“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his"
"cigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”"
"“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,”"
"continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness."
"“Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some"
"people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It"
"is only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between"
"Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our"
"consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of"
"the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say"
"about this Fourth Dimension?”"
"“_I_ have not,” said the Provincial Mayor."
"“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is"
"spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,"
"Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three"
"planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical"
"people have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not"
"another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even"
"tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb"
"was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month"
"or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two"
"dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and"
"similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could"
"represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the"
"thing. See?”"
"“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,"
"he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who"
"repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some"
"time, brightening in a quite transitory manner."
"“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry"
"of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For"
"instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at"
"fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All"
"these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional"
"representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and"
"unalterable thing."
"“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause"
"required for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time"
"is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a"
"weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of"
"the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then"
"this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the"
"mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space"
"generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that"
"line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”"
"“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if"
"Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has"
"it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move"
"in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”"
"The Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in"
"Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,"
"and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions."
"But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”"
"“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”"
"“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the"
"inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”"
"“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man."
"“Easier, far easier down than up.”"
"“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the"
"present moment.”"
"“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the"
"whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present"
"moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no"
"dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform"
"velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_"
"if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”"
"“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You"
"_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about"
"in Time.”"
"“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that"
"we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an"
"incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I"
"become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course"
"we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than"
"a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a"
"civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go"
"up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that"
"ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the"
"Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”"
"“Oh, _this_,” began Filby, “is all—”"
"“Why not?” said the Time Traveller."
"“It’s against reason,” said Filby."
"“What reason?” said the Time Traveller."
"“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will"
"never convince me.”"
"“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the"
"object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long"
"ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”"
"“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man."
"“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as"
"the driver determines.”"
"Filby contented himself with laughter."
"“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller."
"“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist"
"suggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of"
"the Battle of Hastings, for instance!”"
"“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man."
"“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”"
"“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the"
"Very Young Man thought."
"“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The"
"German scholars have improved Greek so much.”"
"“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One"
"might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and"
"hurry on ahead!”"
"“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic"
"basis.”"
"“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist."
"“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”"
"“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify _that_?”"
"“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary."
"“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s"
"all humbug, you know.”"
"The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and"
"with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of"
"the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to"
"his laboratory."
"The Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”"
"“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby"
"tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he"
"had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s"
"anecdote collapsed."
" The Machine"
"The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic"
"framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately"
"made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline"
"substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his"
"explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He"
"took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the"
"room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug."
"On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat"
"down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the"
"bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a"
"dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and"
"several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat"
"in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to"
"be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat"
"behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the"
"Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the"
"Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the"
"Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me"
"that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly"
"done, could have been played upon us under these conditions."
"The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?”"
"said the Psychologist."
"“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon"
"the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only"
"a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will"
"notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd"
"twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way"
"unreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one"
"little white lever, and here is another.”"
"The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing."
"“It’s beautifully made,” he said."
"“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we"
"had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want"
"you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends"
"the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the"
"motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently"
"I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will"
"vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the"
"thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no"
"trickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a"
"quack.”"
"There was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to"
"speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth"
"his finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your"
"hand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand"
"in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the"
"Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its"
"interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain"
"there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame"
"jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little"
"machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost"
"for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;"
"and it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare."
"Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned."
"The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under"
"the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. “Well?” he"
"said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he"
"went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to"
"fill his pipe."
"We stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in"
"earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has"
"travelled into time?”"
"“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the"
"fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s"
"face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped"
"himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have"
"a big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the"
"laboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on"
"my own account.”"
"“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said"
"Filby."
"“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”"
"After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. “It must have"
"gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said."
"“Why?” said the Time Traveller."
"“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled"
"into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must"
"have travelled through this time.”"
"“But,” said I, “If it travelled into the past it would have been"
"visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we"
"were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!”"
"“Serious objections,” remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of"
"impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller."
"“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: “You"
"think. _You_ can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold,"
"you know, diluted presentation.”"
"“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us. “That’s a simple"
"point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough,"
"and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we"
"appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel"
"spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling"
"through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it"
"gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it"
"creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it"
"would make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.” He"
"passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. “You"
"see?” he said, laughing."
"We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time"
"Traveller asked us what we thought of it all."
"“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait"
"until tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”"
"“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time"
"Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way"
"down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly"
"the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of"
"the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how"
"there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little"
"mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of"
"nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of"
"rock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted"
"crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of"
"drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed"
"to be."
"“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you perfectly serious? Or is"
"this a trick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”"
"“Upon that machine,” said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft,"
"“I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in"
"my life.”"
"None of us quite knew how to take it."
"I caught Filby’s eye over the shoulder of the Medical Man, and he"
"winked at me solemnly."
" The Time Traveller Returns"
"I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time"
"Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are"
"too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;"
"you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,"
"behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the"
"matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown _him_ far"
"less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a"
"pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more"
"than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things"
"that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his"
"hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who"
"took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were"
"somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was"
"like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of"
"us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that"
"Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in"
"most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical"
"incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter"
"confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied"
"with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the"
"Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He said he had seen a"
"similar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress on the"
"blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not"
"explain."
"The next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the"
"Time Traveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or"
"five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was"
"standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his"
"watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, and—“It’s"
"half-past seven now,” said the Medical Man. “I suppose we’d better have"
"dinner?”"
"“Where’s——?” said I, naming our host."
"“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks"
"me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says"
"he’ll explain when he comes.”"
"“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Editor of a"
"well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell."
"The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who"
"had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor"
"aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with"
"a beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went,"
"never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at"
"the dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested"
"time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that"
"explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of"
"the “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week. He"
"was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor"
"opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it"
"first. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and the"
"Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good"
"heavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried the Medical Man, who saw him"
"next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door."
"He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared"
"with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to"
"me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually"
"faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut"
"half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense"
"suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been"
"dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just"
"such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in"
"silence, expecting him to speak."
"He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion"
"towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it"
"towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked"
"round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his"
"face. “What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The"
"Time Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb you,” he"
"said, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m all right.” He"
"stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught."
"“That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came"
"into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain"
"dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then"
"he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. “I’m"
"going to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things...."
"Save me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”"
"He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he"
"was all right. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said"
"the Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”"
"He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I"
"remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and"
"standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing"
"on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door"
"closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he"
"detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was"
"wool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I"
"heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this"
"brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table."
"“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he been doing the Amateur"
"Cadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my"
"own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping"
"painfully upstairs. I don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness."
"The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,"
"who rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at"
"dinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork"
"with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed."
"Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of"
"wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. “Does our"
"friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his"
"Nebuchadnezzar phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s this business"
"of the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the Psychologist’s account of"
"our previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The"
"Editor raised objections. “What _was_ this time travelling? A man"
"couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?”"
"And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature."
"Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too,"
"would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work"
"of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of"
"journalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. “Our Special"
"Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,” the Journalist was"
"saying—or rather shouting—when the Time Traveller came back. He was"
"dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look"
"remained of the change that had startled me."
"“I say,” said the Editor hilariously, “these chaps here say you have"
"been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about little"
"Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?”"
"The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word."
"He smiled quietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he said. “What"
"a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!”"
"“Story!” cried the Editor."
"“Story be damned!” said the Time Traveller. “I want something to eat. I"
"won’t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And"
"the salt.”"
"“One word,” said I. “Have you been time travelling?”"
"“Yes,” said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head."
"“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said the Editor. The"
"Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with"
"his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his"
"face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner"
"was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to"
"my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist"
"tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The"
"Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the"
"appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched"
"the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even"
"more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and"
"determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller"
"pushed his plate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must"
"apologise,” he said. “I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing"
"time.” He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come"
"into the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy"
"plates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the"
"adjoining room."
"“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said"
"to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests."
"“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor."
"“I can’t argue tonight. I don’t mind telling you the story, but I can’t"
"argue. I will,” he went on, “tell you the story of what has happened to"
"me, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to"
"tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It’s"
"true—every word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at four"
"o’clock, and since then … I’ve lived eight days … such days as no human"
"being ever lived before! I’m nearly worn out, but I shan’t sleep till"
"I’ve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no"
"interruptions! Is it agreed?”"
"“Agreed,” said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed “Agreed.” And with"
"that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat"
"back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he"
"got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much"
"keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all, my own"
"inadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,"
"attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere"
"face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation"
"of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of"
"his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the"
"smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist"
"and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were"
"illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a"
"time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s"

" Time Travelling"
"“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time"
"Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the"
"workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the"
"ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s"
"sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when"
"the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel"
"bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so"
"that the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten"
"o’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I"
"gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of"
"oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a"
"suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at"
"what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one"
"hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost"
"immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation"
"of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before."
"Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had"
"tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it"
"had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past"
"three!"
"“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both"
"hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark."
"Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards"
"the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the"
"place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I"
"pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the"
"turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The"
"laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow"
"night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and"
"faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb"
"confusedness descended on my mind."
"“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time"
"travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly"
"like that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I"
"felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I"
"put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The"
"dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me,"
"and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every"
"minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had"
"been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression"
"of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any"
"moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast"
"for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively"
"painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the"
"moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a"
"faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still"
"gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one"
"continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a"
"splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun"
"became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter"
"fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and"
"then a brighter circle flickering in the blue."
"“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside upon"
"which this house now stands, and the shoulder rose above me grey and"
"dim. I saw trees growing and changing like puffs of vapour, now brown,"
"now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge"
"buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole"
"surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes."
"The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round"
"faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and"
"down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that"
"consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the"
"white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by"
"the bright, brief green of spring."
"“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They"
"merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,"
"indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to"
"account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind"
"of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I"
"scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new"
"sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my"
"mind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last"
"they took complete possession of me. What strange developments of"
"humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I"
"thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim"
"elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and"
"splendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings"
"of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I"
"saw a richer green flow up the hillside, and remain there, without any"
"wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth"
"seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of"
"stopping."
"“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance"
"in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled"
"at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to"
"speak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of"
"intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of"
"myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant"
"bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle"
"that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching"
"explosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all"
"possible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to"
"me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had"
"cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man"
"has got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the"
"same cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute"
"strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the"
"machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely"
"upset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust"
"of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I"
"lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over,"
"and I was flung headlong through the air."
"“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been"
"stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was"
"sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine. Everything still"
"seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was"
"gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a"
"garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their"
"mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating"
"of the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud"
"over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I"
"was wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has"
"travelled innumerable years to see you.’"
"“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and"
"looked round me. A colossal figure, carved apparently in some white"
"stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy"
"downpour. But all else of the world was invisible."
"“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew"
"thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for"
"a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in"
"shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being"
"carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to"
"hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick"
"with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless"
"eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the"
"lips. It was greatly weather-worn, and that imparted an unpleasant"
"suggestion of disease. I stood looking at it for a little space—half a"
"minute, perhaps, or half an hour. It seemed to advance and to recede as"
"the hail drove before it denser or thinner. At last I tore my eyes from"
"it for a moment, and saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare, and"
"that the sky was lightening with the promise of the sun."
"“I looked up again at the crouching white shape, and the full temerity"
"of my voyage came suddenly upon me. What might appear when that hazy"
"curtain was altogether withdrawn? What might not have happened to men?"
"What if cruelty had grown into a common passion? What if in this"
"interval the race had lost its manliness, and had developed into"
"something inhuman, unsympathetic, and overwhelmingly powerful? I might"
"seem some old-world savage animal, only the more dreadful and"
"disgusting for our common likeness—a foul creature to be incontinently"
"slain."
"“Already I saw other vast shapes—huge buildings with intricate parapets"
"and tall columns, with a wooded hillside dimly creeping in upon me"
"through the lessening storm. I was seized with a panic fear. I turned"
"frantically to the Time Machine, and strove hard to readjust it. As I"
"did so the shafts of the sun smote through the thunderstorm. The grey"
"downpour was swept aside and vanished like the trailing garments of a"
"ghost. Above me, in the intense blue of the summer sky, some faint"
"brown shreds of cloud whirled into nothingness. The great buildings"
"about me stood out clear and distinct, shining with the wet of the"
"thunderstorm, and picked out in white by the unmelted hailstones piled"
"along their courses. I felt naked in a strange world. I felt as perhaps"
"a bird may feel in the clear air, knowing the hawk wings above and will"
"swoop. My fear grew to frenzy. I took a breathing space, set my teeth,"
"and again grappled fiercely, wrist and knee, with the machine. It gave"
"under my desperate onset and turned over. It struck my chin violently."
"One hand on the saddle, the other on the lever, I stood panting heavily"
"in attitude to mount again."
"“But with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered. I"
"looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote"
"future. In a circular opening, high up in the wall of the nearer house,"
"I saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes. They had seen me, and"
"their faces were directed towards me."
"“Then I heard voices approaching me. Coming through the bushes by the"
"White Sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running. One of these"
"emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon which I"
"stood with my machine. He was a slight creature—perhaps four feet"
"high—clad in a purple tunic, girdled at the waist with a leather belt."
"Sandals or buskins—I could not clearly distinguish which—were on his"
"feet; his legs were bare to the knees, and his head was bare. Noticing"
"that, I noticed for the first time how warm the air was."
"“He struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature, but"
"indescribably frail. His flushed face reminded me of the more beautiful"
"kind of consumptive—that hectic beauty of which we used to hear so"
"much. At the sight of him I suddenly regained confidence. I took my"
"hands from the machine."
"“In another moment we were standing face to face, I and this fragile"
"thing out of futurity. He came straight up to me and laughed into my"
"eyes. The absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at"
"once. Then he turned to the two others who were following him and spoke"
"to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue."
"“There were others coming, and presently a little group of perhaps"
"eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me. One of them"
"addressed me. It came into my head, oddly enough, that my voice was too"
"harsh and deep for them. So I shook my head, and, pointing to my ears,"
"shook it again. He came a step forward, hesitated, and then touched my"
"hand. Then I felt other soft little tentacles upon my back and"
"shoulders. They wanted to make sure I was real. There was nothing in"
"this at all alarming. Indeed, there was something in these pretty"
"little people that inspired confidence—a graceful gentleness, a certain"
"childlike ease. And besides, they looked so frail that I could fancy"
"myself flinging the whole dozen of them about like ninepins. But I made"
"a sudden motion to warn them when I saw their little pink hands feeling"
"at the Time Machine. Happily then, when it was not too late, I thought"
"of a danger I had hitherto forgotten, and reaching over the bars of the"
"machine I unscrewed the little levers that would set it in motion, and"
"put these in my pocket. Then I turned again to see what I could do in"
"the way of communication."
"“And then, looking more nearly into their features, I saw some further"
"peculiarities in their Dresden china type of prettiness. Their hair,"
"which was uniformly curly, came to a sharp end at the neck and cheek;"
"there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the face, and their ears"
"were singularly minute. The mouths were small, with bright red, rather"
"thin lips, and the little chins ran to a point. The eyes were large and"
"mild; and—this may seem egotism on my part—I fancied even that there"
"was a certain lack of the interest I might have expected in them."
"“As they made no effort to communicate with me, but simply stood round"
"me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other, I began the"
"conversation. I pointed to the Time Machine and to myself. Then,"
"hesitating for a moment how to express Time, I pointed to the sun. At"
"once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and white"
"followed my gesture, and then astonished me by imitating the sound of"
"thunder."
"“For a moment I was staggered, though the import of his gesture was"
"plain enough. The question had come into my mind abruptly: were these"
"creatures fools? You may hardly understand how it took me. You see, I"
"had always anticipated that the people of the year Eight Hundred and"
"Two Thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in knowledge, art,"
"everything. Then one of them suddenly asked me a question that showed"
"him to be on the intellectual level of one of our five-year-old"
"children—asked me, in fact, if I had come from the sun in a"
"thunderstorm! It let loose the judgment I had suspended upon their"
"clothes, their frail light limbs, and fragile features. A flow of"
"disappointment rushed across my mind. For a moment I felt that I had"
"built the Time Machine in vain."
"“I nodded, pointed to the sun, and gave them such a vivid rendering of"
"a thunderclap as startled them. They all withdrew a pace or so and"
"bowed. Then came one laughing towards me, carrying a chain of beautiful"
"flowers altogether new to me, and put it about my neck. The idea was"
"received with melodious applause; and presently they were all running"
"to and fro for flowers, and laughingly flinging them upon me until I"
"was almost smothered with blossom. You who have never seen the like can"
"scarcely imagine what delicate and wonderful flowers countless years of"
"culture had created. Then someone suggested that their plaything should"
"be exhibited in the nearest building, and so I was led past the sphinx"
"of white marble, which had seemed to watch me all the while with a"
"smile at my astonishment, towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone."
"As I went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a"
"profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came, with irresistible"
"merriment, to my mind."
"“The building had a huge entry, and was altogether of colossal"
"dimensions. I was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of"
"little people, and with the big open portals that yawned before me"
"shadowy and mysterious. My general impression of the world I saw over"
"their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and flowers, a long"
"neglected and yet weedless garden. I saw a number of tall spikes of"
"strange white flowers, measuring a foot perhaps across the spread of"
"the waxen petals. They grew scattered, as if wild, among the variegated"
"shrubs, but, as I say, I did not examine them closely at this time. The"
"Time Machine was left deserted on the turf among the rhododendrons."
"“The arch of the doorway was richly carved, but naturally I did not"
"observe the carving very narrowly, though I fancied I saw suggestions"
"of old Phœnician decorations as I passed through, and it struck me that"
"they were very badly broken and weather-worn. Several more brightly"
"clad people met me in the doorway, and so we entered, I, dressed in"
"dingy nineteenth-century garments, looking grotesque enough, garlanded"
"with flowers, and surrounded by an eddying mass of bright,"
"soft-coloured robes and shining white limbs, in a melodious whirl of"
"laughter and laughing speech."
"“The big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with"
"brown. The roof was in shadow, and the windows, partially glazed with"
"coloured glass and partially unglazed, admitted a tempered light. The"
"floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white metal, not"
"plates nor slabs—blocks, and it was so much worn, as I judged by the"
"going to and fro of past generations, as to be deeply channelled along"
"the more frequented ways. Transverse to the length were innumerable"
"tables made of slabs of polished stone, raised, perhaps, a foot from"
"the floor, and upon these were heaps of fruits. Some I recognised as a"
"kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange, but for the most part they"
"were strange."
"“Between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions. Upon"
"these my conductors seated themselves, signing for me to do likewise."
"With a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the fruit with"
"their hands, flinging peel and stalks, and so forth, into the round"
"openings in the sides of the tables. I was not loath to follow their"
"example, for I felt thirsty and hungry. As I did so I surveyed the hall"
"at my leisure."
"“And perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look."
"The stained-glass windows, which displayed only a geometrical pattern,"
"were broken in many places, and the curtains that hung across the lower"
"end were thick with dust. And it caught my eye that the corner of the"
"marble table near me was fractured. Nevertheless, the general effect"
"was extremely rich and picturesque. There were, perhaps, a couple of"
"hundred people dining in the hall, and most of them, seated as near to"
"me as they could come, were watching me with interest, their little"
"eyes shining over the fruit they were eating. All were clad in the same"
"soft, and yet strong, silky material."
"“Fruit, by the bye, was all their diet. These people of the remote"
"future were strict vegetarians, and while I was with them, in spite of"
"some carnal cravings, I had to be frugivorous also. Indeed, I found"
"afterwards that horses, cattle, sheep, dogs, had followed the"
"Ichthyosaurus into extinction. But the fruits were very delightful;"
"one, in particular, that seemed to be in season all the time I was"
"there—a floury thing in a three-sided husk—was especially good, and I"
"made it my staple. At first I was puzzled by all these strange fruits,"
"and by the strange flowers I saw, but later I began to perceive their"
"import."
"“However, I am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future"
"now. So soon as my appetite was a little checked, I determined to make"
"a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of mine."
"Clearly that was the next thing to do. The fruits seemed a convenient"
"thing to begin upon, and holding one of these up I began a series of"
"interrogative sounds and gestures. I had some considerable difficulty"
"in conveying my meaning. At first my efforts met with a stare of"
"surprise or inextinguishable laughter, but presently a fair-haired"
"little creature seemed to grasp my intention and repeated a name. They"
"had to chatter and explain the business at great length to each other,"
"and my first attempts to make the exquisite little sounds of their"
"language caused an immense amount of genuine, if uncivil, amusement."
"However, I felt like a schoolmaster amidst children, and persisted, and"
"presently I had a score of noun substantives at least at my command;"
"and then I got to demonstrative pronouns, and even the verb ‘to eat.’"
"But it was slow work, and the little people soon tired and wanted to"
"get away from my interrogations, so I determined, rather of necessity,"
"to let them give their lessons in little doses when they felt inclined."
"And very little doses I found they were before long, for I never met"
"people more indolent or more easily fatigued."
" The Sunset of Mankind"
"“A queer thing I soon discovered about my little hosts, and that was"
"their lack of interest. They would come to me with eager cries of"
"astonishment, like children, but, like children they would soon stop"
"examining me, and wander away after some other toy. The dinner and my"
"conversational beginnings ended, I noted for the first time that almost"
"all those who had surrounded me at first were gone. It is odd, too, how"
"speedily I came to disregard these little people. I went out through"
"the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as my hunger was"
"satisfied. I was continually meeting more of these men of the future,"
"who would follow me a little distance, chatter and laugh about me, and,"
"having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly way, leave me again to my"
"own devices."
"“The calm of evening was upon the world as I emerged from the great"
"hall, and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun. At"
"first things were very confusing. Everything was so entirely different"
"from the world I had known—even the flowers. The big building I had"
"left was situated on the slope of a broad river valley, but the Thames"
"had shifted, perhaps, a mile from its present position. I resolved to"
"mount to the summit of a crest, perhaps a mile and a half away, from"
"which I could get a wider view of this our planet in the year Eight"
"Hundred and Two Thousand Seven Hundred and One, A.D. For that, I should"
"explain, was the date the little dials of my machine recorded."
"“As I walked I was watching for every impression that could possibly"
"help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which I found the"
"world—for ruinous it was. A little way up the hill, for instance, was a"
"great heap of granite, bound together by masses of aluminium, a vast"
"labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled heaps, amidst which were"
"thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda-like plants—nettles possibly—but"
"wonderfully tinted with brown about the leaves, and incapable of"
"stinging. It was evidently the derelict remains of some vast structure,"
"to what end built I could not determine. It was here that I was"
"destined, at a later date, to have a very strange experience—the first"
"intimation of a still stranger discovery—but of that I will speak in"
"its proper place."
"“Looking round, with a sudden thought, from a terrace on which I rested"
"for a while, I realised that there were no small houses to be seen."
"Apparently the single house, and possibly even the household, had"
"vanished. Here and there among the greenery were palace-like buildings,"
"but the house and the cottage, which form such characteristic features"
"of our own English landscape, had disappeared."
"“‘Communism,’ said I to myself."
"“And on the heels of that came another thought. I looked at the"
"half-dozen little figures that were following me. Then, in a flash, I"
"perceived that all had the same form of costume, the same soft hairless"
"visage, and the same girlish rotundity of limb. It may seem strange,"
"perhaps, that I had not noticed this before. But everything was so"
"strange. Now, I saw the fact plainly enough. In costume, and in all the"
"differences of texture and bearing that now mark off the sexes from"
"each other, these people of the future were alike. And the children"
"seemed to my eyes to be but the miniatures of their parents. I judged"
"then that the children of that time were extremely precocious,"
"physically at least, and I found afterwards abundant verification of my"
"opinion."
"“Seeing the ease and security in which these people were living, I felt"
"that this close resemblance of the sexes was after all what one would"
"expect; for the strength of a man and the softness of a woman, the"
"institution of the family, and the differentiation of occupations are"
"mere militant necessities of an age of physical force. Where population"
"is balanced and abundant, much childbearing becomes an evil rather than"
"a blessing to the State; where violence comes but rarely and offspring"
"are secure, there is less necessity—indeed there is no necessity—for an"
"efficient family, and the specialisation of the sexes with reference to"
"their children’s needs disappears. We see some beginnings of this even"
"in our own time, and in this future age it was complete. This, I must"
"remind you, was my speculation at the time. Later, I was to appreciate"
"how far it fell short of the reality."
"“While I was musing upon these things, my attention was attracted by a"
"pretty little structure, like a well under a cupola. I thought in a"
"transitory way of the oddness of wells still existing, and then resumed"
"the thread of my speculations. There were no large buildings towards"
"the top of the hill, and as my walking powers were evidently"
"miraculous, I was presently left alone for the first time. With a"
"strange sense of freedom and adventure I pushed on up to the crest."
"“There I found a seat of some yellow metal that I did not recognise,"
"corroded in places with a kind of pinkish rust and half smothered in"
"soft moss, the arm-rests cast and filed into the resemblance of"
"griffins’ heads. I sat down on it, and I surveyed the broad view of our"
"old world under the sunset of that long day. It was as sweet and fair a"
"view as I have ever seen. The sun had already gone below the horizon"
"and the west was flaming gold, touched with some horizontal bars of"
"purple and crimson. Below was the valley of the Thames, in which the"
"river lay like a band of burnished steel. I have already spoken of the"
"great palaces dotted about among the variegated greenery, some in ruins"
"and some still occupied. Here and there rose a white or silvery figure"
"in the waste garden of the earth, here and there came the sharp"
"vertical line of some cupola or obelisk. There were no hedges, no signs"
"of proprietary rights, no evidences of agriculture; the whole earth had"
"become a garden."
"“So watching, I began to put my interpretation upon the things I had"
"seen, and as it shaped itself to me that evening, my interpretation was"
"something in this way. (Afterwards I found I had got only a half"
"truth—or only a glimpse of one facet of the truth.)"
"“It seemed to me that I had happened upon humanity upon the wane. The"
"ruddy sunset set me thinking of the sunset of mankind. For the first"
"time I began to realise an odd consequence of the social effort in"
"which we are at present engaged. And yet, come to think, it is a"
"logical consequence enough. Strength is the outcome of need; security"
"sets a premium on feebleness. The work of ameliorating the conditions"
"of life—the true civilising process that makes life more and more"
"secure—had gone steadily on to a climax. One triumph of a united"
"humanity over Nature had followed another. Things that are now mere"
"dreams had become projects deliberately put in hand and carried"
"forward. And the harvest was what I saw!"
"“After all, the sanitation and the agriculture of today are still in"
"the rudimentary stage. The science of our time has attacked but a"
"little department of the field of human disease, but, even so, it"
"spreads its operations very steadily and persistently. Our agriculture"
"and horticulture destroy a weed just here and there and cultivate"
"perhaps a score or so of wholesome plants, leaving the greater number"
"to fight out a balance as they can. We improve our favourite plants and"
"animals—and how few they are—gradually by selective breeding; now a new"
"and better peach, now a seedless grape, now a sweeter and larger"
"flower, now a more convenient breed of cattle. We improve them"
"gradually, because our ideals are vague and tentative, and our"
"knowledge is very limited; because Nature, too, is shy and slow in our"
"clumsy hands. Some day all this will be better organised, and still"
"better. That is the drift of the current in spite of the eddies. The"
"whole world will be intelligent, educated, and co-operating; things"
"will move faster and faster towards the subjugation of Nature. In the"
"end, wisely and carefully we shall readjust the balance of animal and"
"vegetable life to suit our human needs."
"“This adjustment, I say, must have been done, and done well; done"
"indeed for all Time, in the space of Time across which my machine had"
"leapt. The air was free from gnats, the earth from weeds or fungi;"
"everywhere were fruits and sweet and delightful flowers; brilliant"
"butterflies flew hither and thither. The ideal of preventive medicine"
"was attained. Diseases had been stamped out. I saw no evidence of any"
"contagious diseases during all my stay. And I shall have to tell you"
"later that even the processes of putrefaction and decay had been"
"profoundly affected by these changes."
"“Social triumphs, too, had been effected. I saw mankind housed in"
"splendid shelters, gloriously clothed, and as yet I had found them"
"engaged in no toil. There were no signs of struggle, neither social nor"
"economical struggle. The shop, the advertisement, traffic, all that"
"commerce which constitutes the body of our world, was gone. It was"
"natural on that golden evening that I should jump at the idea of a"
"social paradise. The difficulty of increasing population had been met,"
"I guessed, and population had ceased to increase."
"“But with this change in condition comes inevitably adaptations to the"
"change. What, unless biological science is a mass of errors, is the"
"cause of human intelligence and vigour? Hardship and freedom:"
"conditions under which the active, strong, and subtle survive and the"
"weaker go to the wall; conditions that put a premium upon the loyal"
"alliance of capable men, upon self-restraint, patience, and decision."
"And the institution of the family, and the emotions that arise therein,"
"the fierce jealousy, the tenderness for offspring, parental"
"self-devotion, all found their justification and support in the"
"imminent dangers of the young. _Now_, where are these imminent dangers?"
"There is a sentiment arising, and it will grow, against connubial"
"jealousy, against fierce maternity, against passion of all sorts;"
"unnecessary things now, and things that make us uncomfortable, savage"
"survivals, discords in a refined and pleasant life."
"“I thought of the physical slightness of the people, their lack of"
"intelligence, and those big abundant ruins, and it strengthened my"
"belief in a perfect conquest of Nature. For after the battle comes"
"Quiet. Humanity had been strong, energetic, and intelligent, and had"
"used all its abundant vitality to alter the conditions under which it"
"lived. And now came the reaction of the altered conditions."
"“Under the new conditions of perfect comfort and security, that"
"restless energy, that with us is strength, would become weakness. Even"
"in our own time certain tendencies and desires, once necessary to"
"survival, are a constant source of failure. Physical courage and the"
"love of battle, for instance, are no great help—may even be"
"hindrances—to a civilised man. And in a state of physical balance and"
"security, power, intellectual as well as physical, would be out of"
"place. For countless years I judged there had been no danger of war or"
"solitary violence, no danger from wild beasts, no wasting disease to"
"require strength of constitution, no need of toil. For such a life,"
"what we should call the weak are as well equipped as the strong, are"
"indeed no longer weak. Better equipped indeed they are, for the strong"
"would be fretted by an energy for which there was no outlet. No doubt"
"the exquisite beauty of the buildings I saw was the outcome of the last"
"surgings of the now purposeless energy of mankind before it settled"
"down into perfect harmony with the conditions under which it lived—the"
"flourish of that triumph which began the last great peace. This has"
"ever been the fate of energy in security; it takes to art and to"
"eroticism, and then come languor and decay."
"“Even this artistic impetus would at last die away—had almost died in"
"the Time I saw. To adorn themselves with flowers, to dance, to sing in"
"the sunlight: so much was left of the artistic spirit, and no more."
"Even that would fade in the end into a contented inactivity. We are"
"kept keen on the grindstone of pain and necessity, and it seemed to me"
"that here was that hateful grindstone broken at last!"
"“As I stood there in the gathering dark I thought that in this simple"
"explanation I had mastered the problem of the world—mastered the whole"
"secret of these delicious people. Possibly the checks they had devised"
"for the increase of population had succeeded too well, and their"
"numbers had rather diminished than kept stationary. That would account"
"for the abandoned ruins. Very simple was my explanation, and plausible"
"enough—as most wrong theories are!"
" A Sudden Shock"
"“As I stood there musing over this too perfect triumph of man, the full"
"moon, yellow and gibbous, came up out of an overflow of silver light in"
"the north-east. The bright little figures ceased to move about below, a"
"noiseless owl flitted by, and I shivered with the chill of the night. I"
"determined to descend and find where I could sleep."
"“I looked for the building I knew. Then my eye travelled along to the"
"figure of the White Sphinx upon the pedestal of bronze, growing"
"distinct as the light of the rising moon grew brighter. I could see the"
"silver birch against it. There was the tangle of rhododendron bushes,"
"black in the pale light, and there was the little lawn. I looked at the"
"lawn again. A queer doubt chilled my complacency. ‘No,’ said I stoutly"
"to myself, ‘that was not the lawn.’"
"“But it _was_ the lawn. For the white leprous face of the sphinx was"
"towards it. Can you imagine what I felt as this conviction came home to"
"me? But you cannot. The Time Machine was gone!"
"“At once, like a lash across the face, came the possibility of losing"
"my own age, of being left helpless in this strange new world. The bare"
"thought of it was an actual physical sensation. I could feel it grip me"
"at the throat and stop my breathing. In another moment I was in a"
"passion of fear and running with great leaping strides down the slope."
"Once I fell headlong and cut my face; I lost no time in stanching the"
"blood, but jumped up and ran on, with a warm trickle down my cheek and"
"chin. All the time I ran I was saying to myself: ‘They have moved it a"
"little, pushed it under the bushes out of the way.’ Nevertheless, I ran"
"with all my might. All the time, with the certainty that sometimes"
"comes with excessive dread, I knew that such assurance was folly, knew"
"instinctively that the machine was removed out of my reach. My breath"
"came with pain. I suppose I covered the whole distance from the hill"
"crest to the little lawn, two miles perhaps, in ten minutes. And I am"
"not a young man. I cursed aloud, as I ran, at my confident folly in"
"leaving the machine, wasting good breath thereby. I cried aloud, and"
"none answered. Not a creature seemed to be stirring in that moonlit"
"world."
"“When I reached the lawn my worst fears were realised. Not a trace of"
"the thing was to be seen. I felt faint and cold when I faced the empty"
"space among the black tangle of bushes. I ran round it furiously, as if"
"the thing might be hidden in a corner, and then stopped abruptly, with"
"my hands clutching my hair. Above me towered the sphinx, upon the"
"bronze pedestal, white, shining, leprous, in the light of the rising"
"moon. It seemed to smile in mockery of my dismay."
"“I might have consoled myself by imagining the little people had put"
"the mechanism in some shelter for me, had I not felt assured of their"
"physical and intellectual inadequacy. That is what dismayed me: the"
"sense of some hitherto unsuspected power, through whose intervention my"
"invention had vanished. Yet, for one thing I felt assured: unless some"
"other age had produced its exact duplicate, the machine could not have"
"moved in time. The attachment of the levers—I will show you the method"
"later—prevented anyone from tampering with it in that way when they"
"were removed. It had moved, and was hid, only in space. But then, where"
"could it be?"
"“I think I must have had a kind of frenzy. I remember running violently"
"in and out among the moonlit bushes all round the sphinx, and startling"
"some white animal that, in the dim light, I took for a small deer. I"
"remember, too, late that night, beating the bushes with my clenched"
"fist until my knuckles were gashed and bleeding from the broken twigs."
"Then, sobbing and raving in my anguish of mind, I went down to the"
"great building of stone. The big hall was dark, silent, and deserted. I"
"slipped on the uneven floor, and fell over one of the malachite tables,"
"almost breaking my shin. I lit a match and went on past the dusty"
"curtains, of which I have told you."
"“There I found a second great hall covered with cushions, upon which,"
"perhaps, a score or so of the little people were sleeping. I have no"
"doubt they found my second appearance strange enough, coming suddenly"
"out of the quiet darkness with inarticulate noises and the splutter and"
"flare of a match. For they had forgotten about matches. ‘Where is my"
"Time Machine?’ I began, bawling like an angry child, laying hands upon"
"them and shaking them up together. It must have been very queer to"
"them. Some laughed, most of them looked sorely frightened. When I saw"
"them standing round me, it came into my head that I was doing as"
"foolish a thing as it was possible for me to do under the"
"circumstances, in trying to revive the sensation of fear. For,"
"reasoning from their daylight behaviour, I thought that fear must be"
"forgotten."
"“Abruptly, I dashed down the match, and knocking one of the people over"
"in my course, went blundering across the big dining-hall again, out"
"under the moonlight. I heard cries of terror and their little feet"
"running and stumbling this way and that. I do not remember all I did as"
"the moon crept up the sky. I suppose it was the unexpected nature of my"
"loss that maddened me. I felt hopelessly cut off from my own kind—a"
"strange animal in an unknown world. I must have raved to and fro,"
"screaming and crying upon God and Fate. I have a memory of horrible"
"fatigue, as the long night of despair wore away; of looking in this"
"impossible place and that; of groping among moonlit ruins and touching"
"strange creatures in the black shadows; at last, of lying on the ground"
"near the sphinx and weeping with absolute wretchedness, even anger at"
"the folly of leaving the machine having leaked away with my strength. I"
"had nothing left but misery. Then I slept, and when I woke again it was"
"full day, and a couple of sparrows were hopping round me on the turf"
"within reach of my arm."
"“I sat up in the freshness of the morning, trying to remember how I had"
"got there, and why I had such a profound sense of desertion and"
"despair. Then things came clear in my mind. With the plain, reasonable"
"daylight, I could look my circumstances fairly in the face. I saw the"
"wild folly of my frenzy overnight, and I could reason with myself."
"‘Suppose the worst?’ I said. ‘Suppose the machine altogether"
"lost—perhaps destroyed? It behoves me to be calm and patient, to learn"
"the way of the people, to get a clear idea of the method of my loss,"
"and the means of getting materials and tools; so that in the end,"
"perhaps, I may make another.’ That would be my only hope, a poor hope,"
"perhaps, but better than despair. And, after all, it was a beautiful"
"and curious world."
"“But probably the machine had only been taken away. Still, I must be"
"calm and patient, find its hiding-place, and recover it by force or"
"cunning. And with that I scrambled to my feet and looked about me,"
"wondering where I could bathe. I felt weary, stiff, and travel-soiled."
"The freshness of the morning made me desire an equal freshness. I had"
"exhausted my emotion. Indeed, as I went about my business, I found"
"myself wondering at my intense excitement overnight. I made a careful"
"examination of the ground about the little lawn. I wasted some time in"
"futile questionings, conveyed, as well as I was able, to such of the"
"little people as came by. They all failed to understand my gestures;"
"some were simply stolid, some thought it was a jest and laughed at me."
"I had the hardest task in the world to keep my hands off their pretty"
"laughing faces. It was a foolish impulse, but the devil begotten of"
"fear and blind anger was ill curbed and still eager to take advantage"
"of my perplexity. The turf gave better counsel. I found a groove ripped"
"in it, about midway between the pedestal of the sphinx and the marks of"
"my feet where, on arrival, I had struggled with the overturned machine."
"There were other signs of removal about, with queer narrow footprints"
"like those I could imagine made by a sloth. This directed my closer"
"attention to the pedestal. It was, as I think I have said, of bronze."
"It was not a mere block, but highly decorated with deep framed panels"
"on either side. I went and rapped at these. The pedestal was hollow."
"Examining the panels with care I found them discontinuous with the"
"frames. There were no handles or keyholes, but possibly the panels, if"
"they were doors, as I supposed, opened from within. One thing was clear"
"enough to my mind. It took no very great mental effort to infer that my"
"Time Machine was inside that pedestal. But how it got there was a"
"different problem."
"“I saw the heads of two orange-clad people coming through the bushes"
"and under some blossom-covered apple-trees towards me. I turned smiling"
"to them, and beckoned them to me. They came, and then, pointing to the"
"bronze pedestal, I tried to intimate my wish to open it. But at my"
"first gesture towards this they behaved very oddly. I don’t know how to"
"convey their expression to you. Suppose you were to use a grossly"
"improper gesture to a delicate-minded woman—it is how she would look."
"They went off as if they had received the last possible insult. I tried"
"a sweet-looking little chap in white next, with exactly the same"
"result. Somehow, his manner made me feel ashamed of myself. But, as you"
"know, I wanted the Time Machine, and I tried him once more. As he"
"turned off, like the others, my temper got the better of me. In three"
"strides I was after him, had him by the loose part of his robe round"
"the neck, and began dragging him towards the sphinx. Then I saw the"
"horror and repugnance of his face, and all of a sudden I let him go."
"“But I was not beaten yet. I banged with my fist at the bronze panels."
"I thought I heard something stir inside—to be explicit, I thought I"
"heard a sound like a chuckle—but I must have been mistaken. Then I got"
"a big pebble from the river, and came and hammered till I had flattened"
"a coil in the decorations, and the verdigris came off in powdery"
"flakes. The delicate little people must have heard me hammering in"
"gusty outbreaks a mile away on either hand, but nothing came of it. I"
"saw a crowd of them upon the slopes, looking furtively at me. At last,"
"hot and tired, I sat down to watch the place. But I was too restless to"
"watch long; I am too Occidental for a long vigil. I could work at a"
"problem for years, but to wait inactive for twenty-four hours—that is"
"another matter."
"“I got up after a time, and began walking aimlessly through the bushes"
"towards the hill again. ‘Patience,’ said I to myself. ‘If you want your"
"machine again you must leave that sphinx alone. If they mean to take"
"your machine away, it’s little good your wrecking their bronze panels,"
"and if they don’t, you will get it back as soon as you can ask for it."
"To sit among all those unknown things before a puzzle like that is"
"hopeless. That way lies monomania. Face this world. Learn its ways,"
"watch it, be careful of too hasty guesses at its meaning. In the end"
"you will find clues to it all.’ Then suddenly the humour of the"
"situation came into my mind: the thought of the years I had spent in"
"study and toil to get into the future age, and now my passion of"
"anxiety to get out of it. I had made myself the most complicated and"
"the most hopeless trap that ever a man devised. Although it was at my"
"own expense, I could not help myself. I laughed aloud."
"“Going through the big palace, it seemed to me that the little people"
"avoided me. It may have been my fancy, or it may have had something to"
"do with my hammering at the gates of bronze. Yet I felt tolerably sure"
"of the avoidance. I was careful, however, to show no concern and to"
"abstain from any pursuit of them, and in the course of a day or two"
"things got back to the old footing. I made what progress I could in the"
"language, and in addition I pushed my explorations here and there."
"Either I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively"
"simple—almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs."
"There seemed to be few, if any, abstract terms, or little use of"
"figurative language. Their sentences were usually simple and of two"
"words, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest"
"propositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and"
"the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx, as much as possible"
"in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to"
"them in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand,"
"tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival."
" Explanation"
"“So far as I could see, all the world displayed the same exuberant"
"richness as the Thames valley. From every hill I climbed I saw the same"
"abundance of splendid buildings, endlessly varied in material and"
"style, the same clustering thickets of evergreens, the same"
"blossom-laden trees and tree ferns. Here and there water shone like"
"silver, and beyond, the land rose into blue undulating hills, and so"
"faded into the serenity of the sky. A peculiar feature, which presently"
"attracted my attention, was the presence of certain circular wells,"
"several, as it seemed to me, of a very great depth. One lay by the path"
"up the hill which I had followed during my first walk. Like the others,"
"it was rimmed with bronze, curiously wrought, and protected by a little"
"cupola from the rain. Sitting by the side of these wells, and peering"
"down into the shafted darkness, I could see no gleam of water, nor"
"could I start any reflection with a lighted match. But in all of them I"
"heard a certain sound: a thud—thud—thud, like the beating of some big"
"engine; and I discovered, from the flaring of my matches, that a steady"
"current of air set down the shafts. Further, I threw a scrap of paper"
"into the throat of one, and, instead of fluttering slowly down, it was"
"at once sucked swiftly out of sight."
"“After a time, too, I came to connect these wells with tall towers"
"standing here and there upon the slopes; for above them there was often"
"just such a flicker in the air as one sees on a hot day above a"
"sun-scorched beach. Putting things together, I reached a strong"
"suggestion of an extensive system of subterranean ventilation, whose"
"true import it was difficult to imagine. I was at first inclined to"
"associate it with the sanitary apparatus of these people. It was an"
"obvious conclusion, but it was absolutely wrong."
"“And here I must admit that I learnt very little of drains and bells"
"and modes of conveyance, and the like conveniences, during my time in"
"this real future. In some of these visions of Utopias and coming times"
"which I have read, there is a vast amount of detail about building, and"
"social arrangements, and so forth. But while such details are easy"
"enough to obtain when the whole world is contained in one’s"
"imagination, they are altogether inaccessible to a real traveller amid"
"such realities as I found here. Conceive the tale of London which a"
"negro, fresh from Central Africa, would take back to his tribe! What"
"would he know of railway companies, of social movements, of telephone"
"and telegraph wires, of the Parcels Delivery Company, and postal orders"
"and the like? Yet we, at least, should be willing enough to explain"
"these things to him! And even of what he knew, how much could he make"
"his untravelled friend either apprehend or believe? Then, think how"
"narrow the gap between a negro and a white man of our own times, and"
"how wide the interval between myself and these of the Golden Age! I was"
"sensible of much which was unseen, and which contributed to my comfort;"
"but save for a general impression of automatic organisation, I fear I"
"can convey very little of the difference to your mind."
"“In the matter of sepulture, for instance, I could see no signs of"
"crematoria nor anything suggestive of tombs. But it occurred to me"
"that, possibly, there might be cemeteries (or crematoria) somewhere"
"beyond the range of my explorings. This, again, was a question I"
"deliberately put to myself, and my curiosity was at first entirely"
"defeated upon the point. The thing puzzled me, and I was led to make a"
"further remark, which puzzled me still more: that aged and infirm among"
"this people there were none."
"“I must confess that my satisfaction with my first theories of an"
"automatic civilisation and a decadent humanity did not long endure. Yet"
"I could think of no other. Let me put my difficulties. The several big"
"palaces I had explored were mere living places, great dining-halls and"
"sleeping apartments. I could find no machinery, no appliances of any"
"kind. Yet these people were clothed in pleasant fabrics that must at"
"times need renewal, and their sandals, though undecorated, were fairly"
"complex specimens of metalwork. Somehow such things must be made. And"
"the little people displayed no vestige of a creative tendency. There"
"were no shops, no workshops, no sign of importations among them. They"
"spent all their time in playing gently, in bathing in the river, in"
"making love in a half-playful fashion, in eating fruit and sleeping. I"
"could not see how things were kept going."
"“Then, again, about the Time Machine: something, I knew not what, had"
"taken it into the hollow pedestal of the White Sphinx. _Why?_ For the"
"life of me I could not imagine. Those waterless wells, too, those"
"flickering pillars. I felt I lacked a clue. I felt—how shall I put it?"
"Suppose you found an inscription, with sentences here and there in"
"excellent plain English, and interpolated therewith, others made up of"
"words, of letters even, absolutely unknown to you? Well, on the third"
"day of my visit, that was how the world of Eight Hundred and Two"
"Thousand Seven Hundred and One presented itself to me!"
"“That day, too, I made a friend—of a sort. It happened that, as I was"
"watching some of the little people bathing in a shallow, one of them"
"was seized with cramp and began drifting downstream. The main current"
"ran rather swiftly, but not too strongly for even a moderate swimmer."
"It will give you an idea, therefore, of the strange deficiency in these"
"creatures, when I tell you that none made the slightest attempt to"
"rescue the weakly crying little thing which was drowning before their"
"eyes. When I realised this, I hurriedly slipped off my clothes, and,"
"wading in at a point lower down, I caught the poor mite and drew her"
"safe to land. A little rubbing of the limbs soon brought her round, and"
"I had the satisfaction of seeing she was all right before I left her. I"
"had got to such a low estimate of her kind that I did not expect any"
"gratitude from her. In that, however, I was wrong."
"“This happened in the morning. In the afternoon I met my little woman,"
"as I believe it was, as I was returning towards my centre from an"
"exploration, and she received me with cries of delight and presented me"
"with a big garland of flowers—evidently made for me and me alone. The"
"thing took my imagination. Very possibly I had been feeling desolate."
"At any rate I did my best to display my appreciation of the gift. We"
"were soon seated together in a little stone arbour, engaged in"
"conversation, chiefly of smiles. The creature’s friendliness affected"
"me exactly as a child’s might have done. We passed each other flowers,"
"and she kissed my hands. I did the same to hers. Then I tried talk, and"
"found that her name was Weena, which, though I don’t know what it"
"meant, somehow seemed appropriate enough. That was the beginning of a"
"queer friendship which lasted a week, and ended—as I will tell you!"
"“She was exactly like a child. She wanted to be with me always. She"
"tried to follow me everywhere, and on my next journey out and about it"
"went to my heart to tire her down, and leave her at last, exhausted and"
"calling after me rather plaintively. But the problems of the world had"
"to be mastered. I had not, I said to myself, come into the future to"
"carry on a miniature flirtation. Yet her distress when I left her was"
"very great, her expostulations at the parting were sometimes frantic,"
"and I think, altogether, I had as much trouble as comfort from her"
"devotion. Nevertheless she was, somehow, a very great comfort. I"
"thought it was mere childish affection that made her cling to me. Until"
"it was too late, I did not clearly know what I had inflicted upon her"
"when I left her. Nor until it was too late did I clearly understand"
"what she was to me. For, by merely seeming fond of me, and showing in"
"her weak, futile way that she cared for me, the little doll of a"
"creature presently gave my return to the neighbourhood of the White"
"Sphinx almost the feeling of coming home; and I would watch for her"
"tiny figure of white and gold so soon as I came over the hill."
"“It was from her, too, that I learnt that fear had not yet left the"
"world. She was fearless enough in the daylight, and she had the oddest"
"confidence in me; for once, in a foolish moment, I made threatening"
"grimaces at her, and she simply laughed at them. But she dreaded the"
"dark, dreaded shadows, dreaded black things. Darkness to her was the"
"one thing dreadful. It was a singularly passionate emotion, and it set"
"me thinking and observing. I discovered then, among other things, that"
"these little people gathered into the great houses after dark, and"
"slept in droves. To enter upon them without a light was to put them"
"into a tumult of apprehension. I never found one out of doors, or one"
"sleeping alone within doors, after dark. Yet I was still such a"
"blockhead that I missed the lesson of that fear, and in spite of"
"Weena’s distress, I insisted upon sleeping away from these slumbering"
"multitudes."
"“It troubled her greatly, but in the end her odd affection for me"
"triumphed, and for five of the nights of our acquaintance, including"
"the last night of all, she slept with her head pillowed on my arm. But"
"my story slips away from me as I speak of her. It must have been the"
"night before her rescue that I was awakened about dawn. I had been"
"restless, dreaming most disagreeably that I was drowned, and that sea"
"anemones were feeling over my face with their soft palps. I woke with a"
"start, and with an odd fancy that some greyish animal had just rushed"
"out of the chamber. I tried to get to sleep again, but I felt restless"
"and uncomfortable. It was that dim grey hour when things are just"
"creeping out of darkness, when everything is colourless and clear cut,"
"and yet unreal. I got up, and went down into the great hall, and so out"
"upon the flagstones in front of the palace. I thought I would make a"
"virtue of necessity, and see the sunrise."
"“The moon was setting, and the dying moonlight and the first pallor of"
"dawn were mingled in a ghastly half-light. The bushes were inky black,"
"the ground a sombre grey, the sky colourless and cheerless. And up the"
"hill I thought I could see ghosts. Three several times, as I scanned"
"the slope, I saw white figures. Twice I fancied I saw a solitary white,"
"ape-like creature running rather quickly up the hill, and once near the"
"ruins I saw a leash of them carrying some dark body. They moved"
"hastily. I did not see what became of them. It seemed that they"
"vanished among the bushes. The dawn was still indistinct, you must"
"understand. I was feeling that chill, uncertain, early-morning feeling"
"you may have known. I doubted my eyes."
"“As the eastern sky grew brighter, and the light of the day came on and"
"its vivid colouring returned upon the world once more, I scanned the"
"view keenly. But I saw no vestige of my white figures. They were mere"
"creatures of the half-light. ‘They must have been ghosts,’ I said; ‘I"
"wonder whence they dated.’ For a queer notion of Grant Allen’s came"
"into my head, and amused me. If each generation die and leave ghosts,"
"he argued, the world at last will get overcrowded with them. On that"
"theory they would have grown innumerable some Eight Hundred Thousand"
"Years hence, and it was no great wonder to see four at once. But the"
"jest was unsatisfying, and I was thinking of these figures all the"
"morning, until Weena’s rescue drove them out of my head. I associated"
"them in some indefinite way with the white animal I had startled in my"
"first passionate search for the Time Machine. But Weena was a pleasant"
"substitute. Yet all the same, they were soon destined to take far"
"deadlier possession of my mind."
"“I think I have said how much hotter than our own was the weather of"
"this Golden Age. I cannot account for it. It may be that the sun was"
"hotter, or the earth nearer the sun. It is usual to assume that the sun"
"will go on cooling steadily in the future. But people, unfamiliar with"
"such speculations as those of the younger Darwin, forget that the"
"planets must ultimately fall back one by one into the parent body. As"
"these catastrophes occur, the sun will blaze with renewed energy; and"
"it may be that some inner planet had suffered this fate. Whatever the"
"reason, the fact remains that the sun was very much hotter than we know"
"it."
"“Well, one very hot morning—my fourth, I think—as I was seeking shelter"
"from the heat and glare in a colossal ruin near the great house where I"
"slept and fed, there happened this strange thing. Clambering among"
"these heaps of masonry, I found a narrow gallery, whose end and side"
"windows were blocked by fallen masses of stone. By contrast with the"
"brilliancy outside, it seemed at first impenetrably dark to me. I"
"entered it groping, for the change from light to blackness made spots"
"of colour swim before me. Suddenly I halted spellbound. A pair of eyes,"
"luminous by reflection against the daylight without, was watching me"
"out of the darkness."
"“The old instinctive dread of wild beasts came upon me. I clenched my"
"hands and steadfastly looked into the glaring eyeballs. I was afraid to"
"turn. Then the thought of the absolute security in which humanity"
"appeared to be living came to my mind. And then I remembered that"
"strange terror of the dark. Overcoming my fear to some extent, I"
"advanced a step and spoke. I will admit that my voice was harsh and"
"ill-controlled. I put out my hand and touched something soft. At once"
"the eyes darted sideways, and something white ran past me. I turned"
"with my heart in my mouth, and saw a queer little ape-like figure, its"
"head held down in a peculiar manner, running across the sunlit space"
"behind me. It blundered against a block of granite, staggered aside,"
"and in a moment was hidden in a black shadow beneath another pile of"
"ruined masonry."
"“My impression of it is, of course, imperfect; but I know it was a dull"
"white, and had strange large greyish-red eyes; also that there was"
"flaxen hair on its head and down its back. But, as I say, it went too"
"fast for me to see distinctly. I cannot even say whether it ran on all"
"fours, or only with its forearms held very low. After an instant’s"
"pause I followed it into the second heap of ruins. I could not find it"
"at first; but, after a time in the profound obscurity, I came upon one"
"of those round well-like openings of which I have told you, half closed"
"by a fallen pillar. A sudden thought came to me. Could this Thing have"
"vanished down the shaft? I lit a match, and, looking down, I saw a"
"small, white, moving creature, with large bright eyes which regarded me"
"steadfastly as it retreated. It made me shudder. It was so like a human"
"spider! It was clambering down the wall, and now I saw for the first"
"time a number of metal foot and hand rests forming a kind of ladder"
"down the shaft. Then the light burned my fingers and fell out of my"
"hand, going out as it dropped, and when I had lit another the little"
"monster had disappeared."
"“I do not know how long I sat peering down that well. It was not for"
"some time that I could succeed in persuading myself that the thing I"
"had seen was human. But, gradually, the truth dawned on me: that Man"
"had not remained one species, but had differentiated into two distinct"
"animals: that my graceful children of the Upper World were not the sole"
"descendants of our generation, but that this bleached, obscene,"
"nocturnal Thing, which had flashed before me, was also heir to all the"
"ages."
"“I thought of the flickering pillars and of my theory of an underground"
"ventilation. I began to suspect their true import. And what, I"
"wondered, was this Lemur doing in my scheme of a perfectly balanced"
"organisation? How was it related to the indolent serenity of the"
"beautiful Overworlders? And what was hidden down there, at the foot of"
"that shaft? I sat upon the edge of the well telling myself that, at any"
"rate, there was nothing to fear, and that there I must descend for the"
"solution of my difficulties. And withal I was absolutely afraid to go!"
"As I hesitated, two of the beautiful upperworld people came running in"
"their amorous sport across the daylight in the shadow. The male pursued"
"the female, flinging flowers at her as he ran."
"“They seemed distressed to find me, my arm against the overturned"
"pillar, peering down the well. Apparently it was considered bad form to"
"remark these apertures; for when I pointed to this one, and tried to"
"frame a question about it in their tongue, they were still more visibly"
"distressed and turned away. But they were interested by my matches, and"
"I struck some to amuse them. I tried them again about the well, and"
"again I failed. So presently I left them, meaning to go back to Weena,"
"and see what I could get from her. But my mind was already in"
"revolution; my guesses and impressions were slipping and sliding to a"
"new adjustment. I had now a clue to the import of these wells, to the"
"ventilating towers, to the mystery of the ghosts; to say nothing of a"
"hint at the meaning of the bronze gates and the fate of the Time"
"Machine! And very vaguely there came a suggestion towards the solution"
"of the economic problem that had puzzled me."
"“Here was the new view. Plainly, this second species of Man was"
"subterranean. There were three circumstances in particular which made"
"me think that its rare emergence above ground was the outcome of a"
"long-continued underground habit. In the first place, there was the"
"bleached look common in most animals that live largely in the dark—the"
"white fish of the Kentucky caves, for instance. Then, those large eyes,"
"with that capacity for reflecting light, are common features of"
"nocturnal things—witness the owl and the cat. And last of all, that"
"evident confusion in the sunshine, that hasty yet fumbling awkward"
"flight towards dark shadow, and that peculiar carriage of the head"
"while in the light—all reinforced the theory of an extreme"
"sensitiveness of the retina."
"“Beneath my feet, then, the earth must be tunnelled enormously, and"
"these tunnellings were the habitat of the New Race. The presence of"
"ventilating shafts and wells along the hill slopes—everywhere, in fact,"
"except along the river valley—showed how universal were its"
"ramifications. What so natural, then, as to assume that it was in this"
"artificial Underworld that such work as was necessary to the comfort of"
"the daylight race was done? The notion was so plausible that I at once"
"accepted it, and went on to assume the _how_ of this splitting of the"
"human species. I dare say you will anticipate the shape of my theory;"
"though, for myself, I very soon felt that it fell far short of the"
"truth."
"“At first, proceeding from the problems of our own age, it seemed clear"
"as daylight to me that the gradual widening of the present merely"
"temporary and social difference between the Capitalist and the Labourer"
"was the key to the whole position. No doubt it will seem grotesque"
"enough to you—and wildly incredible!—and yet even now there are"
"existing circumstances to point that way. There is a tendency to"
"utilise underground space for the less ornamental purposes of"
"civilisation; there is the Metropolitan Railway in London, for"
"instance, there are new electric railways, there are subways, there are"
"underground workrooms and restaurants, and they increase and multiply."
"Evidently, I thought, this tendency had increased till Industry had"
"gradually lost its birthright in the sky. I mean that it had gone"
"deeper and deeper into larger and ever larger underground factories,"
"spending a still-increasing amount of its time therein, till, in the"
"end—! Even now, does not an East-end worker live in such artificial"
"conditions as practically to be cut off from the natural surface of the"
"earth?"
"“Again, the exclusive tendency of richer people—due, no doubt, to the"
"increasing refinement of their education, and the widening gulf between"
"them and the rude violence of the poor—is already leading to the"
"closing, in their interest, of considerable portions of the surface of"
"the land. About London, for instance, perhaps half the prettier country"
"is shut in against intrusion. And this same widening gulf—which is due"
"to the length and expense of the higher educational process and the"
"increased facilities for and temptations towards refined habits on the"
"part of the rich—will make that exchange between class and class, that"
"promotion by intermarriage which at present retards the splitting of"
"our species along lines of social stratification, less and less"
"frequent. So, in the end, above ground you must have the Haves,"
"pursuing pleasure and comfort and beauty, and below ground the"
"Have-nots, the Workers getting continually adapted to the conditions of"
"their labour. Once they were there, they would no doubt have to pay"
"rent, and not a little of it, for the ventilation of their caverns; and"
"if they refused, they would starve or be suffocated for arrears. Such"
"of them as were so constituted as to be miserable and rebellious would"
"die; and, in the end, the balance being permanent, the survivors would"
"become as well adapted to the conditions of underground life, and as"
"happy in their way, as the Overworld people were to theirs. As it"
"seemed to me, the refined beauty and the etiolated pallor followed"
"naturally enough."
"“The great triumph of Humanity I had dreamed of took a different shape"
"in my mind. It had been no such triumph of moral education and general"
"co-operation as I had imagined. Instead, I saw a real aristocracy,"
"armed with a perfected science and working to a logical conclusion the"
"industrial system of today. Its triumph had not been simply a triumph"
"over Nature, but a triumph over Nature and the fellow-man. This, I must"
"warn you, was my theory at the time. I had no convenient cicerone in"
"the pattern of the Utopian books. My explanation may be absolutely"
"wrong. I still think it is the most plausible one. But even on this"
"supposition the balanced civilisation that was at last attained must"
"have long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay."
"The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow"
"movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and"
"intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had"
"happened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I"
"had seen of the Morlocks—that, by the bye, was the name by which these"
"creatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the"
"human type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the"
"beautiful race that I already knew."
"“Then came troublesome doubts. Why had the Morlocks taken my Time"
"Machine? For I felt sure it was they who had taken it. Why, too, if the"
"Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why"
"were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said,"
"to question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was"
"disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and"
"presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic"
"was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she"
"burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw"
"in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about"
"the Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her"
"human inheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and"
"clapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match."
" The Morlocks"
"“It may seem odd to you, but it was two days before I could follow up"
"the new-found clue in what was manifestly the proper way. I felt a"
"peculiar shrinking from those pallid bodies. They were just the"
"half-bleached colour of the worms and things one sees preserved in"
"spirit in a zoological museum. And they were filthily cold to the"
"touch. Probably my shrinking was largely due to the sympathetic"
"influence of the Eloi, whose disgust of the Morlocks I now began to"
"appreciate."
"“The next night I did not sleep well. Probably my health was a little"
"disordered. I was oppressed with perplexity and doubt. Once or twice I"
"had a feeling of intense fear for which I could perceive no definite"
"reason. I remember creeping noiselessly into the great hall where the"
"little people were sleeping in the moonlight—that night Weena was among"
"them—and feeling reassured by their presence. It occurred to me even"
"then, that in the course of a few days the moon must pass through its"
"last quarter, and the nights grow dark, when the appearances of these"
"unpleasant creatures from below, these whitened Lemurs, this new vermin"
"that had replaced the old, might be more abundant. And on both these"
"days I had the restless feeling of one who shirks an inevitable duty. I"
"felt assured that the Time Machine was only to be recovered by boldly"
"penetrating these mysteries of underground. Yet I could not face the"
"mystery. If only I had had a companion it would have been different."
"But I was so horribly alone, and even to clamber down into the darkness"
"of the well appalled me. I don’t know if you will understand my"
"feeling, but I never felt quite safe at my back."
"“It was this restlessness, this insecurity, perhaps, that drove me"
"farther and farther afield in my exploring expeditions. Going to the"
"south-westward towards the rising country that is now called Combe"
"Wood, I observed far-off, in the direction of nineteenth-century"
"Banstead, a vast green structure, different in character from any I had"
"hitherto seen. It was larger than the largest of the palaces or ruins I"
"knew, and the façade had an Oriental look: the face of it having the"
"lustre, as well as the pale-green tint, a kind of bluish-green, of a"
"certain type of Chinese porcelain. This difference in aspect suggested"
"a difference in use, and I was minded to push on and explore. But the"
"day was growing late, and I had come upon the sight of the place after"
"a long and tiring circuit; so I resolved to hold over the adventure for"
"the following day, and I returned to the welcome and the caresses of"
"little Weena. But next morning I perceived clearly enough that my"
"curiosity regarding the Palace of Green Porcelain was a piece of"
"self-deception, to enable me to shirk, by another day, an experience I"
"dreaded. I resolved I would make the descent without further waste of"
"time, and started out in the early morning towards a well near the"
"ruins of granite and aluminium."
"“Little Weena ran with me. She danced beside me to the well, but when"
"she saw me lean over the mouth and look downward, she seemed strangely"
"disconcerted. ‘Good-bye, little Weena,’ I said, kissing her; and then"
"putting her down, I began to feel over the parapet for the climbing"
"hooks. Rather hastily, I may as well confess, for I feared my courage"
"might leak away! At first she watched me in amazement. Then she gave a"
"most piteous cry, and running to me, she began to pull at me with her"
"little hands. I think her opposition nerved me rather to proceed. I"
"shook her off, perhaps a little roughly, and in another moment I was in"
"the throat of the well. I saw her agonised face over the parapet, and"
"smiled to reassure her. Then I had to look down at the unstable hooks"
"to which I clung."
"“I had to clamber down a shaft of perhaps two hundred yards. The"
"descent was effected by means of metallic bars projecting from the"
"sides of the well, and these being adapted to the needs of a creature"
"much smaller and lighter than myself, I was speedily cramped and"
"fatigued by the descent. And not simply fatigued! One of the bars bent"
"suddenly under my weight, and almost swung me off into the blackness"
"beneath. For a moment I hung by one hand, and after that experience I"
"did not dare to rest again. Though my arms and back were presently"
"acutely painful, I went on clambering down the sheer descent with as"
"quick a motion as possible. Glancing upward, I saw the aperture, a"
"small blue disc, in which a star was visible, while little Weena’s head"
"showed as a round black projection. The thudding sound of a machine"
"below grew louder and more oppressive. Everything save that little disc"
"above was profoundly dark, and when I looked up again Weena had"
"disappeared."
"“I was in an agony of discomfort. I had some thought of trying to go up"
"the shaft again, and leave the Underworld alone. But even while I"
"turned this over in my mind I continued to descend. At last, with"
"intense relief, I saw dimly coming up, a foot to the right of me, a"
"slender loophole in the wall. Swinging myself in, I found it was the"
"aperture of a narrow horizontal tunnel in which I could lie down and"
"rest. It was not too soon. My arms ached, my back was cramped, and I"
"was trembling with the prolonged terror of a fall. Besides this, the"
"unbroken darkness had had a distressing effect upon my eyes. The air"
"was full of the throb and hum of machinery pumping air down the shaft."
"“I do not know how long I lay. I was arroused by a soft hand touching"
"my face. Starting up in the darkness I snatched at my matches and,"
"hastily striking one, I saw three stooping white creatures similar to"
"the one I had seen above ground in the ruin, hastily retreating before"
"the light. Living, as they did, in what appeared to me impenetrable"
"darkness, their eyes were abnormally large and sensitive, just as are"
"the pupils of the abysmal fishes, and they reflected the light in the"
"same way. I have no doubt they could see me in that rayless obscurity,"
"and they did not seem to have any fear of me apart from the light. But,"
"so soon as I struck a match in order to see them, they fled"
"incontinently, vanishing into dark gutters and tunnels, from which"
"their eyes glared at me in the strangest fashion."
"“I tried to call to them, but the language they had was apparently"
"different from that of the Overworld people; so that I was needs left"
"to my own unaided efforts, and the thought of flight before exploration"
"was even then in my mind. But I said to myself, ‘You are in for it"
"now,’ and, feeling my way along the tunnel, I found the noise of"
"machinery grow louder. Presently the walls fell away from me, and I"
"came to a large open space, and striking another match, saw that I had"
"entered a vast arched cavern, which stretched into utter darkness"
"beyond the range of my light. The view I had of it was as much as one"
"could see in the burning of a match."
"“Necessarily my memory is vague. Great shapes like big machines rose"
"out of the dimness, and cast grotesque black shadows, in which dim"
"spectral Morlocks sheltered from the glare. The place, by the bye, was"
"very stuffy and oppressive, and the faint halitus of freshly-shed blood"
"was in the air. Some way down the central vista was a little table of"
"white metal, laid with what seemed a meal. The Morlocks at any rate"
"were carnivorous! Even at the time, I remember wondering what large"
"animal could have survived to furnish the red joint I saw. It was all"
"very indistinct: the heavy smell, the big unmeaning shapes, the obscene"
"figures lurking in the shadows, and only waiting for the darkness to"
"come at me again! Then the match burnt down, and stung my fingers, and"
"fell, a wriggling red spot in the blackness."
"“I have thought since how particularly ill-equipped I was for such an"
"experience. When I had started with the Time Machine, I had started"
"with the absurd assumption that the men of the Future would certainly"
"be infinitely ahead of ourselves in all their appliances. I had come"
"without arms, without medicine, without anything to smoke—at times I"
"missed tobacco frightfully!—even without enough matches. If only I had"
"thought of a Kodak! I could have flashed that glimpse of the Underworld"
"in a second, and examined it at leisure. But, as it was, I stood there"
"with only the weapons and the powers that Nature had endowed me"
"with—hands, feet, and teeth; these, and four safety-matches that still"
"remained to me."
"“I was afraid to push my way in among all this machinery in the dark,"
"and it was only with my last glimpse of light I discovered that my"
"store of matches had run low. It had never occurred to me until that"
"moment that there was any need to economise them, and I had wasted"
"almost half the box in astonishing the Overworlders, to whom fire was a"
"novelty. Now, as I say, I had four left, and while I stood in the dark,"
"a hand touched mine, lank fingers came feeling over my face, and I was"
"sensible of a peculiar unpleasant odour. I fancied I heard the"
"breathing of a crowd of those dreadful little beings about me. I felt"
"the box of matches in my hand being gently disengaged, and other hands"
"behind me plucking at my clothing. The sense of these unseen creatures"
"examining me was indescribably unpleasant. The sudden realisation of my"
"ignorance of their ways of thinking and doing came home to me very"
"vividly in the darkness. I shouted at them as loudly as I could. They"
"started away, and then I could feel them approaching me again. They"
"clutched at me more boldly, whispering odd sounds to each other. I"
"shivered violently, and shouted again—rather discordantly. This time"
"they were not so seriously alarmed, and they made a queer laughing"
"noise as they came back at me. I will confess I was horribly"
"frightened. I determined to strike another match and escape under the"
"protection of its glare. I did so, and eking out the flicker with a"
"scrap of paper from my pocket, I made good my retreat to the narrow"
"tunnel. But I had scarce entered this when my light was blown out and"
"in the blackness I could hear the Morlocks rustling like wind among"
"leaves, and pattering like the rain, as they hurried after me."
"“In a moment I was clutched by several hands, and there was no"
"mistaking that they were trying to haul me back. I struck another"
"light, and waved it in their dazzled faces. You can scarce imagine how"
"nauseatingly inhuman they looked—those pale, chinless faces and great,"
"lidless, pinkish-grey eyes!—as they stared in their blindness and"
"bewilderment. But I did not stay to look, I promise you: I retreated"
"again, and when my second match had ended, I struck my third. It had"
"almost burnt through when I reached the opening into the shaft. I lay"
"down on the edge, for the throb of the great pump below made me giddy."
"Then I felt sideways for the projecting hooks, and, as I did so, my"
"feet were grasped from behind, and I was violently tugged backward. I"
"lit my last match … and it incontinently went out. But I had my hand on"
"the climbing bars now, and, kicking violently, I disengaged myself from"
"the clutches of the Morlocks, and was speedily clambering up the shaft,"
"while they stayed peering and blinking up at me: all but one little"
"wretch who followed me for some way, and well-nigh secured my boot as a"
"trophy."
"“That climb seemed interminable to me. With the last twenty or thirty"
"feet of it a deadly nausea came upon me. I had the greatest difficulty"
"in keeping my hold. The last few yards was a frightful struggle against"
"this faintness. Several times my head swam, and I felt all the"
"sensations of falling. At last, however, I got over the well-mouth"
"somehow, and staggered out of the ruin into the blinding sunlight. I"
"fell upon my face. Even the soil smelt sweet and clean. Then I remember"
"Weena kissing my hands and ears, and the voices of others among the"
"Eloi. Then, for a time, I was insensible."
" When Night Came"
"“Now, indeed, I seemed in a worse case than before. Hitherto, except"
"during my night’s anguish at the loss of the Time Machine, I had felt a"
"sustaining hope of ultimate escape, but that hope was staggered by"
"these new discoveries. Hitherto I had merely thought myself impeded by"
"the childish simplicity of the little people, and by some unknown"
"forces which I had only to understand to overcome; but there was an"
"altogether new element in the sickening quality of the Morlocks—a"
"something inhuman and malign. Instinctively I loathed them. Before, I"
"had felt as a man might feel who had fallen into a pit: my concern was"
"with the pit and how to get out of it. Now I felt like a beast in a"
"trap, whose enemy would come upon him soon."
"“The enemy I dreaded may surprise you. It was the darkness of the new"
"moon. Weena had put this into my head by some at first incomprehensible"
"remarks about the Dark Nights. It was not now such a very difficult"
"problem to guess what the coming Dark Nights might mean. The moon was"
"on the wane: each night there was a longer interval of darkness. And I"
"now understood to some slight degree at least the reason of the fear of"
"the little Upperworld people for the dark. I wondered vaguely what foul"
"villainy it might be that the Morlocks did under the new moon. I felt"
"pretty sure now that my second hypothesis was all wrong. The Upperworld"
"people might once have been the favoured aristocracy, and the Morlocks"
"their mechanical servants: but that had long since passed away. The two"
"species that had resulted from the evolution of man were sliding down"
"towards, or had already arrived at, an altogether new relationship. The"
"Eloi, like the Carlovignan kings, had decayed to a mere beautiful"
"futility. They still possessed the earth on sufferance: since the"
"Morlocks, subterranean for innumerable generations, had come at last to"
"find the daylit surface intolerable. And the Morlocks made their"
"garments, I inferred, and maintained them in their habitual needs,"
"perhaps through the survival of an old habit of service. They did it as"
"a standing horse paws with his foot, or as a man enjoys killing animals"
"in sport: because ancient and departed necessities had impressed it on"
"the organism. But, clearly, the old order was already in part reversed."
"The Nemesis of the delicate ones was creeping on apace. Ages ago,"
"thousands of generations ago, man had thrust his brother man out of the"
"ease and the sunshine. And now that brother was coming back—changed!"
"Already the Eloi had begun to learn one old lesson anew. They were"
"becoming reacquainted with Fear. And suddenly there came into my head"
"the memory of the meat I had seen in the Underworld. It seemed odd how"
"it floated into my mind: not stirred up as it were by the current of my"
"meditations, but coming in almost like a question from outside. I tried"
"to recall the form of it. I had a vague sense of something familiar,"
"but I could not tell what it was at the time."
"“Still, however helpless the little people in the presence of their"
"mysterious Fear, I was differently constituted. I came out of this age"
"of ours, this ripe prime of the human race, when Fear does not paralyse"
"and mystery has lost its terrors. I at least would defend myself."
"Without further delay I determined to make myself arms and a fastness"
"where I might sleep. With that refuge as a base, I could face this"
"strange world with some of that confidence I had lost in realising to"
"what creatures night by night I lay exposed. I felt I could never sleep"
"again until my bed was secure from them. I shuddered with horror to"
"think how they must already have examined me."
"“I wandered during the afternoon along the valley of the Thames, but"
"found nothing that commended itself to my mind as inaccessible. All the"
"buildings and trees seemed easily practicable to such dexterous"
"climbers as the Morlocks, to judge by their wells, must be. Then the"
"tall pinnacles of the Palace of Green Porcelain and the polished gleam"
"of its walls came back to my memory; and in the evening, taking Weena"
"like a child upon my shoulder, I went up the hills towards the"
"south-west. The distance, I had reckoned, was seven or eight miles, but"
"it must have been nearer eighteen. I had first seen the place on a"
"moist afternoon when distances are deceptively diminished. In addition,"
"the heel of one of my shoes was loose, and a nail was working through"
"the sole—they were comfortable old shoes I wore about indoors—so that I"
"was lame. And it was already long past sunset when I came in sight of"
"the palace, silhouetted black against the pale yellow of the sky."
"“Weena had been hugely delighted when I began to carry her, but after a"
"while she desired me to let her down, and ran along by the side of me,"
"occasionally darting off on either hand to pick flowers to stick in my"
"pockets. My pockets had always puzzled Weena, but at the last she had"
"concluded that they were an eccentric kind of vases for floral"
"decoration. At least she utilised them for that purpose. And that"
"reminds me! In changing my jacket I found…”"
"_The Time Traveller paused, put his hand into his pocket, and silently"
"placed two withered flowers, not unlike very large white mallows, upon"
"the little table. Then he resumed his narrative._"
"“As the hush of evening crept over the world and we proceeded over the"
"hill crest towards Wimbledon, Weena grew tired and wanted to return to"
"the house of grey stone. But I pointed out the distant pinnacles of the"
"Palace of Green Porcelain to her, and contrived to make her understand"
"that we were seeking a refuge there from her Fear. You know that great"
"pause that comes upon things before the dusk? Even the breeze stops in"
"the trees. To me there is always an air of expectation about that"
"evening stillness. The sky was clear, remote, and empty save for a few"
"horizontal bars far down in the sunset. Well, that night the"
"expectation took the colour of my fears. In that darkling calm my"
"senses seemed preternaturally sharpened. I fancied I could even feel"
"the hollowness of the ground beneath my feet: could, indeed, almost see"
"through it the Morlocks on their ant-hill going hither and thither and"
"waiting for the dark. In my excitement I fancied that they would"
"receive my invasion of their burrows as a declaration of war. And why"
"had they taken my Time Machine?"
"“So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The"
"clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out."
"The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena’s fears and her fatigue"
"grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed"
"her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck,"
"and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So"
"we went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I"
"almost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the"
"opposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a"
"statue—a Faun, or some such figure, _minus_ the head. Here too were"
"acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet"
"early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were"
"still to come."
"“From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and"
"black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either"
"to the right or the left. Feeling tired—my feet, in particular, were"
"very sore—I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and"
"sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green"
"Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the"
"thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that"
"dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even"
"were there no other lurking danger—a danger I did not care to let my"
"imagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble"
"over and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after"
"the excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but"
"would pass the night upon the open hill."
"“Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in"
"my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The"
"hillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there"
"came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars,"
"for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly"
"comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from"
"the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a"
"hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar"
"groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same"
"tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it)"
"was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more"
"splendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these scintillating"
"points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the"
"face of an old friend."
"“Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the"
"gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable"
"distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the"
"unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great"
"precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty"
"times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I"
"had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all"
"the traditions, the complex organisations, the nations, languages,"
"literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him,"
"had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who"
"had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went"
"in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two"
"species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear"
"knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it was too"
"horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white"
"and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought."
"“Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I"
"could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs"
"of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very"
"clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then,"
"as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the"
"reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and"
"peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing"
"it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No"
"Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that"
"night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that"
"my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the"
"loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat"
"down again, took off my shoes, and flung them away."
"“I awakened Weena, and we went down into the wood, now green and"
"pleasant instead of black and forbidding. We found some fruit wherewith"
"to break our fast. We soon met others of the dainty ones, laughing and"
"dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as"
"the night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I"
"felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I"
"pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly,"
"at some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks’ food had run"
"short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now"
"man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he"
"was—far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no"
"deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men——! I tried to"
"look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less"
"human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four"
"thousand years ago. And the intelligence that would have made this"
"state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These"
"Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and"
"preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena"
"dancing at my side!"
"“Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon"
"me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man"
"had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his"
"fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the"
"fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a"
"Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this"
"attitude of mind was impossible. However great their intellectual"
"degradation, the Eloi had kept too much of the human form not to claim"
"my sympathy, and to make me perforce a sharer in their degradation and"
"their Fear."
"“I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue."
"My first was to secure some safe place of refuge, and to make myself"
"such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was"
"immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so"
"that I should have the weapon of a torch at hand, for nothing, I knew,"
"would be more efficient against these Morlocks. Then I wanted to"
"arrange some contrivance to break open the doors of bronze under the"
"White Sphinx. I had in mind a battering ram. I had a persuasion that if"
"I could enter those doors and carry a blaze of light before me I should"
"discover the Time Machine and escape. I could not imagine the Morlocks"
"were strong enough to move it far away. Weena I had resolved to bring"
"with me to our own time. And turning such schemes over in my mind I"
"pursued our way towards the building which my fancy had chosen as our"
"dwelling."
" The Palace of Green Porcelain"
"“I found the Palace of Green Porcelain, when we approached it about"
"noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass"
"remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had"
"fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon"
"a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was"
"surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged"
"Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then—though I"
"never followed up the thought—of what might have happened, or might be"
"happening, to the living things in the sea."
"“The material of the Palace proved on examination to be indeed"
"porcelain, and along the face of it I saw an inscription in some"
"unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help"
"me to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing"
"had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more"
"human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human."
"“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found,"
"instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows."
"At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was"
"thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was"
"shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange"
"and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of"
"a huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some"
"extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and"
"the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place,"
"where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing"
"itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton"
"barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going"
"towards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and"
"clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of"
"our own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair"
"preservation of some of their contents."
"“Clearly we stood among the ruins of some latter-day South Kensington!"
"Here, apparently, was the Palæontological Section, and a very splendid"
"array of fossils it must have been, though the inevitable process of"
"decay that had been staved off for a time, and had, through the"
"extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its"
"force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness"
"at work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of"
"the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or"
"threaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances"
"been bodily removed—by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very"
"silent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been"
"rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came,"
"as I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside"
"me."
"“And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an"
"intellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities it"
"presented. Even my preoccupation about the Time Machine receded a"
"little from my mind."
"“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain"
"had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology; possibly"
"historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in"
"my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than"
"this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another"
"short gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be"
"devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind"
"running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no"
"nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the"
"sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the"
"rest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the"
"best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist"
"in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel"
"to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been"
"devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of"
"recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once"
"been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held"
"spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for"
"that, because I should have been glad to trace the patient"
"readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been"
"attained. Then we came to a gallery of simply colossal proportions, but"
"singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle"
"from the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from"
"the ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that"
"originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my"
"element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big"
"machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still"
"fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and"
"I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part"
"they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest"
"guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their"
"puzzles I should find myself in possession of powers that might be of"
"use against the Morlocks."
"“Suddenly Weena came very close to my side. So suddenly that she"
"startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have"
"noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may"
"be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was"
"built into the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite"
"above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down"
"the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last"
"there was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only"
"a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling"
"about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the"
"gradual diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions"
"drew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a"
"thick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that"
"the dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away"
"towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small"
"narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks"
"revived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic"
"examination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far"
"advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge,"
"and no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of"
"the gallery I heard a peculiar pattering, and the same odd noises I had"
"heard down the well."
"“I took Weena’s hand. Then, struck with a sudden idea, I left her and"
"turned to a machine from which projected a lever not unlike those in a"
"signal-box. Clambering upon the stand, and grasping this lever in my"
"hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted"
"in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of"
"the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and"
"I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged,"
"for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill"
"a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing"
"one’s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any"
"humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a"
"persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time"
"Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the"
"gallery and killing the brutes I heard."
"“Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that"
"gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first"
"glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The"
"brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently"
"recognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since"
"dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here"
"and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the"
"tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have"
"moralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing"
"that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to"
"which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I"
"will confess that I thought chiefly of the _Philosophical Transactions_"
"and my own seventeen papers upon physical optics."
"“Then, going up a broad staircase, we came to what may once have been a"
"gallery of technical chemistry. And here I had not a little hope of"
"useful discoveries. Except at one end where the roof had collapsed,"
"this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case."
"And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of"
"matches. Very eagerly I tried them. They were perfectly good. They were"
"not even damp. I turned to Weena. ‘Dance,’ I cried to her in her own"
"tongue. For now I had a weapon indeed against the horrible creatures we"
"feared. And so, in that derelict museum, upon the thick soft carpeting"
"of dust, to Weena’s huge delight, I solemnly performed a kind of"
"composite dance, whistling _The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I"
"could. In part it was a modest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part"
"a skirt dance (so far as my tail-coat permitted), and in part original."
"For I am naturally inventive, as you know."
"“Now, I still think that for this box of matches to have escaped the"
"wear of time for immemorial years was a most strange, as for me it was"
"a most fortunate, thing. Yet, oddly enough, I found a far unlikelier"
"substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by"
"chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at"
"first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But"
"the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this"
"volatile substance had chanced to survive, perhaps through many"
"thousands of centuries. It reminded me of a sepia painting I had once"
"seen done from the ink of a fossil Belemnite that must have perished"
"and become fossilised millions of years ago. I was about to throw it"
"away, but I remembered that it was inflammable and burnt with a good"
"bright flame—was, in fact, an excellent candle—and I put it in my"
"pocket. I found no explosives, however, nor any means of breaking down"
"the bronze doors. As yet my iron crowbar was the most helpful thing I"
"had chanced upon. Nevertheless I left that gallery greatly elated."
"“I cannot tell you all the story of that long afternoon. It would"
"require a great effort of memory to recall my explorations in at all"
"the proper order. I remember a long gallery of rusting stands of arms,"
"and how I hesitated between my crowbar and a hatchet or a sword. I"
"could not carry both, however, and my bar of iron promised best against"
"the bronze gates. There were numbers of guns, pistols, and rifles. The"
"most were masses of rust, but many were of some new metal, and still"
"fairly sound. But any cartridges or powder there may once have been had"
"rotted into dust. One corner I saw was charred and shattered; perhaps,"
"I thought, by an explosion among the specimens. In another place was a"
"vast array of idols—Polynesian, Mexican, Grecian, Phœnician, every"
"country on earth, I should think. And here, yielding to an irresistible"
"impulse, I wrote my name upon the nose of a steatite monster from South"
"America that particularly took my fancy."
"“As the evening drew on, my interest waned. I went through gallery"
"after gallery, dusty, silent, often ruinous, the exhibits sometimes"
"mere heaps of rust and lignite, sometimes fresher. In one place I"
"suddenly found myself near the model of a tin mine, and then by the"
"merest accident I discovered, in an air-tight case, two dynamite"
"cartridges! I shouted ‘Eureka!’ and smashed the case with joy. Then"
"came a doubt. I hesitated. Then, selecting a little side gallery, I"
"made my essay. I never felt such a disappointment as I did in waiting"
"five, ten, fifteen minutes for an explosion that never came. Of course"
"the things were dummies, as I might have guessed from their presence. I"
"really believe that had they not been so, I should have rushed off"
"incontinently and blown Sphinx, bronze doors, and (as it proved) my"
"chances of finding the Time Machine, all together into non-existence."
"“It was after that, I think, that we came to a little open court within"
"the palace. It was turfed, and had three fruit-trees. So we rested and"
"refreshed ourselves. Towards sunset I began to consider our position."
"Night was creeping upon us, and my inaccessible hiding-place had still"
"to be found. But that troubled me very little now. I had in my"
"possession a thing that was, perhaps, the best of all defences against"
"the Morlocks—I had matches! I had the camphor in my pocket, too, if a"
"blaze were needed. It seemed to me that the best thing we could do"
"would be to pass the night in the open, protected by a fire. In the"
"morning there was the getting of the Time Machine. Towards that, as"
"yet, I had only my iron mace. But now, with my growing knowledge, I"
"felt very differently towards those bronze doors. Up to this, I had"
"refrained from forcing them, largely because of the mystery on the"
"other side. They had never impressed me as being very strong, and I"
"hoped to find my bar of iron not altogether inadequate for the work."
"“We emerged from the Palace while the sun was still in part above the"
"horizon. I was determined to reach the White Sphinx early the next"
"morning, and ere the dusk I purposed pushing through the woods that had"
"stopped me on the previous journey. My plan was to go as far as"
"possible that night, and then, building a fire, to sleep in the"
"protection of its glare. Accordingly, as we went along I gathered any"
"sticks or dried grass I saw, and presently had my arms full of such"
"litter. Thus loaded, our progress was slower than I had anticipated,"
"and besides Weena was tired. And I, also, began to suffer from"
"sleepiness too; so that it was full night before we reached the wood."
"Upon the shrubby hill of its edge Weena would have stopped, fearing the"
"darkness before us; but a singular sense of impending calamity, that"
"should indeed have served me as a warning, drove me onward. I had been"
"without sleep for a night and two days, and I was feverish and"
"irritable. I felt sleep coming upon me, and the Morlocks with it."
"“While we hesitated, among the black bushes behind us, and dim against"
"their blackness, I saw three crouching figures. There was scrub and"
"long grass all about us, and I did not feel safe from their insidious"
"approach. The forest, I calculated, was rather less than a mile across."
"If we could get through it to the bare hillside, there, as it seemed to"
"me, was an altogether safer resting-place; I thought that with my"
"matches and my camphor I could contrive to keep my path illuminated"
"through the woods. Yet it was evident that if I was to flourish matches"
"with my hands I should have to abandon my firewood; so, rather"
"reluctantly, I put it down. And then it came into my head that I would"
"amaze our friends behind by lighting it. I was to discover the"
"atrocious folly of this proceeding, but it came to my mind as an"
"ingenious move for covering our retreat."
"“I don’t know if you have ever thought what a rare thing flame must be"
"in the absence of man and in a temperate climate. The sun’s heat is"
"rarely strong enough to burn, even when it is focused by dewdrops, as"
"is sometimes the case in more tropical districts. Lightning may blast"
"and blacken, but it rarely gives rise to widespread fire. Decaying"
"vegetation may occasionally smoulder with the heat of its fermentation,"
"but this rarely results in flame. In this decadence, too, the art of"
"fire-making had been forgotten on the earth. The red tongues that went"
"licking up my heap of wood were an altogether new and strange thing to"
"Weena."
"“She wanted to run to it and play with it. I believe she would have"
"cast herself into it had I not restrained her. But I caught her up, and"
"in spite of her struggles, plunged boldly before me into the wood. For"
"a little way the glare of my fire lit the path. Looking back presently,"
"I could see, through the crowded stems, that from my heap of sticks the"
"blaze had spread to some bushes adjacent, and a curved line of fire was"
"creeping up the grass of the hill. I laughed at that, and turned again"
"to the dark trees before me. It was very black, and Weena clung to me"
"convulsively, but there was still, as my eyes grew accustomed to the"
"darkness, sufficient light for me to avoid the stems. Overhead it was"
"simply black, except where a gap of remote blue sky shone down upon us"
"here and there. I lit none of my matches because I had no hand free."
"Upon my left arm I carried my little one, in my right hand I had my"
"iron bar."
"“For some way I heard nothing but the crackling twigs under my feet,"
"the faint rustle of the breeze above, and my own breathing and the"
"throb of the blood-vessels in my ears. Then I seemed to know of a"
"pattering behind me. I pushed on grimly. The pattering grew more"
"distinct, and then I caught the same queer sound and voices I had heard"
"in the Underworld. There were evidently several of the Morlocks, and"
"they were closing in upon me. Indeed, in another minute I felt a tug at"
"my coat, then something at my arm. And Weena shivered violently, and"
"became quite still."
"“It was time for a match. But to get one I must put her down. I did so,"
"and, as I fumbled with my pocket, a struggle began in the darkness"
"about my knees, perfectly silent on her part and with the same peculiar"
"cooing sounds from the Morlocks. Soft little hands, too, were creeping"
"over my coat and back, touching even my neck. Then the match scratched"
"and fizzed. I held it flaring, and saw the white backs of the Morlocks"
"in flight amid the trees. I hastily took a lump of camphor from my"
"pocket, and prepared to light it as soon as the match should wane. Then"
"I looked at Weena. She was lying clutching my feet and quite"
"motionless, with her face to the ground. With a sudden fright I stooped"
"to her. She seemed scarcely to breathe. I lit the block of camphor and"
"flung it to the ground, and as it split and flared up and drove back"
"the Morlocks and the shadows, I knelt down and lifted her. The wood"
"behind seemed full of the stir and murmur of a great company!"
"“She seemed to have fainted. I put her carefully upon my shoulder and"
"rose to push on, and then there came a horrible realisation. In"
"manœuvring with my matches and Weena, I had turned myself about several"
"times, and now I had not the faintest idea in what direction lay my"
"path. For all I knew, I might be facing back towards the Palace of"
"Green Porcelain. I found myself in a cold sweat. I had to think rapidly"
"what to do. I determined to build a fire and encamp where we were. I"
"put Weena, still motionless, down upon a turfy bole, and very hastily,"
"as my first lump of camphor waned, I began collecting sticks and"
"leaves. Here and there out of the darkness round me the Morlocks’ eyes"
"shone like carbuncles."
"“The camphor flickered and went out. I lit a match, and as I did so,"
"two white forms that had been approaching Weena dashed hastily away."
"One was so blinded by the light that he came straight for me, and I"
"felt his bones grind under the blow of my fist. He gave a whoop of"
"dismay, staggered a little way, and fell down. I lit another piece of"
"camphor, and went on gathering my bonfire. Presently I noticed how dry"
"was some of the foliage above me, for since my arrival on the Time"
"Machine, a matter of a week, no rain had fallen. So, instead of casting"
"about among the trees for fallen twigs, I began leaping up and dragging"
"down branches. Very soon I had a choking smoky fire of green wood and"
"dry sticks, and could economise my camphor. Then I turned to where"
"Weena lay beside my iron mace. I tried what I could to revive her, but"
"she lay like one dead. I could not even satisfy myself whether or not"
"she breathed."
"“Now, the smoke of the fire beat over towards me, and it must have made"
"me heavy of a sudden. Moreover, the vapour of camphor was in the air."
"My fire would not need replenishing for an hour or so. I felt very"
"weary after my exertion, and sat down. The wood, too, was full of a"
"slumbrous murmur that I did not understand. I seemed just to nod and"
"open my eyes. But all was dark, and the Morlocks had their hands upon"
"me. Flinging off their clinging fingers I hastily felt in my pocket for"
"the match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me"
"again. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire"
"had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest"
"seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by"
"the hair, by the arms, and pulled down. It was indescribably horrible"
"in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt"
"as if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went"
"down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I"
"did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I"
"struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar"
"short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the"
"succulent giving of flesh and bone under my blows, and for a moment I"
"was free."
"“The strange exultation that so often seems to accompany hard fighting"
"came upon me. I knew that both I and Weena were lost, but I determined"
"to make the Morlocks pay for their meat. I stood with my back to a"
"tree, swinging the iron bar before me. The whole wood was full of the"
"stir and cries of them. A minute passed. Their voices seemed to rise to"
"a higher pitch of excitement, and their movements grew faster. Yet none"
"came within reach. I stood glaring at the blackness. Then suddenly came"
"hope. What if the Morlocks were afraid? And close on the heels of that"
"came a strange thing. The darkness seemed to grow luminous. Very dimly"
"I began to see the Morlocks about me—three battered at my feet—and then"
"I recognised, with incredulous surprise, that the others were running,"
"in an incessant stream, as it seemed, from behind me, and away through"
"the wood in front. And their backs seemed no longer white, but reddish."
"As I stood agape, I saw a little red spark go drifting across a gap of"
"starlight between the branches, and vanish. And at that I understood"
"the smell of burning wood, the slumbrous murmur that was growing now"
"into a gusty roar, the red glow, and the Morlocks’ flight."
"“Stepping out from behind my tree and looking back, I saw, through the"
"black pillars of the nearer trees, the flames of the burning forest. It"
"was my first fire coming after me. With that I looked for Weena, but"
"she was gone. The hissing and crackling behind me, the explosive thud"
"as each fresh tree burst into flame, left little time for reflection."
"My iron bar still gripped, I followed in the Morlocks’ path. It was a"
"close race. Once the flames crept forward so swiftly on my right as I"
"ran that I was outflanked and had to strike off to the left. But at"
"last I emerged upon a small open space, and as I did so, a Morlock came"
"blundering towards me, and past me, and went on straight into the fire!"
"“And now I was to see the most weird and horrible thing, I think, of"
"all that I beheld in that future age. This whole space was as bright as"
"day with the reflection of the fire. In the centre was a hillock or"
"tumulus, surmounted by a scorched hawthorn. Beyond this was another arm"
"of the burning forest, with yellow tongues already writhing from it,"
"completely encircling the space with a fence of fire. Upon the hillside"
"were some thirty or forty Morlocks, dazzled by the light and heat, and"
"blundering hither and thither against each other in their bewilderment."
"At first I did not realise their blindness, and struck furiously at"
"them with my bar, in a frenzy of fear, as they approached me, killing"
"one and crippling several more. But when I had watched the gestures of"
"one of them groping under the hawthorn against the red sky, and heard"
"their moans, I was assured of their absolute helplessness and misery in"
"the glare, and I struck no more of them."
"“Yet every now and then one would come straight towards me, setting"
"loose a quivering horror that made me quick to elude him. At one time"
"the flames died down somewhat, and I feared the foul creatures would"
"presently be able to see me. I was thinking of beginning the fight by"
"killing some of them before this should happen; but the fire burst out"
"again brightly, and I stayed my hand. I walked about the hill among"
"them and avoided them, looking for some trace of Weena. But Weena was"
"gone."
"“At last I sat down on the summit of the hillock, and watched this"
"strange incredible company of blind things groping to and fro, and"
"making uncanny noises to each other, as the glare of the fire beat on"
"them. The coiling uprush of smoke streamed across the sky, and through"
"the rare tatters of that red canopy, remote as though they belonged to"
"another universe, shone the little stars. Two or three Morlocks came"
"blundering into me, and I drove them off with blows of my fists,"
"trembling as I did so."
"“For the most part of that night I was persuaded it was a nightmare. I"
"bit myself and screamed in a passionate desire to awake. I beat the"
"ground with my hands, and got up and sat down again, and wandered here"
"and there, and again sat down. Then I would fall to rubbing my eyes and"
"calling upon God to let me awake. Thrice I saw Morlocks put their heads"
"down in a kind of agony and rush into the flames. But, at last, above"
"the subsiding red of the fire, above the streaming masses of black"
"smoke and the whitening and blackening tree stumps, and the diminishing"
"numbers of these dim creatures, came the white light of the day."
"“I searched again for traces of Weena, but there were none. It was"
"plain that they had left her poor little body in the forest. I cannot"
"describe how it relieved me to think that it had escaped the awful fate"
"to which it seemed destined. As I thought of that, I was almost moved"
"to begin a massacre of the helpless abominations about me, but I"
"contained myself. The hillock, as I have said, was a kind of island in"
"the forest. From its summit I could now make out through a haze of"
"smoke the Palace of Green Porcelain, and from that I could get my"
"bearings for the White Sphinx. And so, leaving the remnant of these"
"damned souls still going hither and thither and moaning, as the day"
"grew clearer, I tied some grass about my feet and limped on across"
"smoking ashes and among black stems that still pulsated internally with"
"fire, towards the hiding-place of the Time Machine. I walked slowly,"
"for I was almost exhausted, as well as lame, and I felt the intensest"
"wretchedness for the horrible death of little Weena. It seemed an"
"overwhelming calamity. Now, in this old familiar room, it is more like"
"the sorrow of a dream than an actual loss. But that morning it left me"
"absolutely lonely again—terribly alone. I began to think of this house"
"of mine, of this fireside, of some of you, and with such thoughts came"
"a longing that was pain."
"“But, as I walked over the smoking ashes under the bright morning sky,"
"I made a discovery. In my trouser pocket were still some loose matches."
"The box must have leaked before it was lost."
" The Trap of the White Sphinx"
"“About eight or nine in the morning I came to the same seat of yellow"
"metal from which I had viewed the world upon the evening of my arrival."
"I thought of my hasty conclusions upon that evening and could not"
"refrain from laughing bitterly at my confidence. Here was the same"
"beautiful scene, the same abundant foliage, the same splendid palaces"
"and magnificent ruins, the same silver river running between its"
"fertile banks. The gay robes of the beautiful people moved hither and"
"thither among the trees. Some were bathing in exactly the place where I"
"had saved Weena, and that suddenly gave me a keen stab of pain. And"
"like blots upon the landscape rose the cupolas above the ways to the"
"Underworld. I understood now what all the beauty of the Overworld"
"people covered. Very pleasant was their day, as pleasant as the day of"
"the cattle in the field. Like the cattle, they knew of no enemies and"
"provided against no needs. And their end was the same."
"“I grieved to think how brief the dream of the human intellect had"
"been. It had committed suicide. It had set itself steadfastly towards"
"comfort and ease, a balanced society with security and permanency as"
"its watchword, it had attained its hopes—to come to this at last. Once,"
"life and property must have reached almost absolute safety. The rich"
"had been assured of his wealth and comfort, the toiler assured of his"
"life and work. No doubt in that perfect world there had been no"
"unemployed problem, no social question left unsolved. And a great quiet"
"had followed."
"“It is a law of nature we overlook, that intellectual versatility is"
"the compensation for change, danger, and trouble. An animal perfectly"
"in harmony with its environment is a perfect mechanism. Nature never"
"appeals to intelligence until habit and instinct are useless. There is"
"no intelligence where there is no change and no need of change. Only"
"those animals partake of intelligence that have to meet a huge variety"
"of needs and dangers."
"“So, as I see it, the Upperworld man had drifted towards his feeble"
"prettiness, and the Underworld to mere mechanical industry. But that"
"perfect state had lacked one thing even for mechanical"
"perfection—absolute permanency. Apparently as time went on, the feeding"
"of an Underworld, however it was effected, had become disjointed."
"Mother Necessity, who had been staved off for a few thousand years,"
"came back again, and she began below. The Underworld being in contact"
"with machinery, which, however perfect, still needs some little thought"
"outside habit, had probably retained perforce rather more initiative,"
"if less of every other human character, than the Upper. And when other"
"meat failed them, they turned to what old habit had hitherto forbidden."
"So I say I saw it in my last view of the world of Eight Hundred and Two"
"Thousand Seven Hundred and One. It may be as wrong an explanation as"
"mortal wit could invent. It is how the thing shaped itself to me, and"
"as that I give it to you."
"“After the fatigues, excitements, and terrors of the past days, and in"
"spite of my grief, this seat and the tranquil view and the warm"
"sunlight were very pleasant. I was very tired and sleepy, and soon my"
"theorising passed into dozing. Catching myself at that, I took my own"
"hint, and spreading myself out upon the turf I had a long and"
"refreshing sleep."
"“I awoke a little before sunsetting. I now felt safe against being"
"caught napping by the Morlocks, and, stretching myself, I came on down"
"the hill towards the White Sphinx. I had my crowbar in one hand, and"
"the other hand played with the matches in my pocket."
"“And now came a most unexpected thing. As I approached the pedestal of"
"the sphinx I found the bronze valves were open. They had slid down into"
"grooves."
"“At that I stopped short before them, hesitating to enter."
"“Within was a small apartment, and on a raised place in the corner of"
"this was the Time Machine. I had the small levers in my pocket. So"
"here, after all my elaborate preparations for the siege of the White"
"Sphinx, was a meek surrender. I threw my iron bar away, almost sorry"
"not to use it."
"“A sudden thought came into my head as I stooped towards the portal."
"For once, at least, I grasped the mental operations of the Morlocks."
"Suppressing a strong inclination to laugh, I stepped through the bronze"
"frame and up to the Time Machine. I was surprised to find it had been"
"carefully oiled and cleaned. I have suspected since that the Morlocks"
"had even partially taken it to pieces while trying in their dim way to"
"grasp its purpose."
"“Now as I stood and examined it, finding a pleasure in the mere touch"
"of the contrivance, the thing I had expected happened. The bronze"
"panels suddenly slid up and struck the frame with a clang. I was in the"
"dark—trapped. So the Morlocks thought. At that I chuckled gleefully."
"“I could already hear their murmuring laughter as they came towards me."
"Very calmly I tried to strike the match. I had only to fix on the"
"levers and depart then like a ghost. But I had overlooked one little"
"thing. The matches were of that abominable kind that light only on the"
"box."
"“You may imagine how all my calm vanished. The little brutes were close"
"upon me. One touched me. I made a sweeping blow in the dark at them"
"with the levers, and began to scramble into the saddle of the machine."
"Then came one hand upon me and then another. Then I had simply to fight"
"against their persistent fingers for my levers, and at the same time"
"feel for the studs over which these fitted. One, indeed, they almost"
"got away from me. As it slipped from my hand, I had to butt in the dark"
"with my head—I could hear the Morlock’s skull ring—to recover it. It"
"was a nearer thing than the fight in the forest, I think, this last"
"scramble."
"“But at last the lever was fixed and pulled over. The clinging hands"
"slipped from me. The darkness presently fell from my eyes. I found"
"myself in the same grey light and tumult I have already described."
" The Further Vision"
"“I have already told you of the sickness and confusion that comes with"
"time travelling. And this time I was not seated properly in the saddle,"
"but sideways and in an unstable fashion. For an indefinite time I clung"
"to the machine as it swayed and vibrated, quite unheeding how I went,"
"and when I brought myself to look at the dials again I was amazed to"
"find where I had arrived. One dial records days, and another thousands"
"of days, another millions of days, and another thousands of millions."
"Now, instead of reversing the levers, I had pulled them over so as to"
"go forward with them, and when I came to look at these indicators I"
"found that the thousands hand was sweeping round as fast as the seconds"
"hand of a watch—into futurity."
"“As I drove on, a peculiar change crept over the appearance of things."
"The palpitating greyness grew darker; then—though I was still"
"travelling with prodigious velocity—the blinking succession of day and"
"night, which was usually indicative of a slower pace, returned, and"
"grew more and more marked. This puzzled me very much at first. The"
"alternations of night and day grew slower and slower, and so did the"
"passage of the sun across the sky, until they seemed to stretch through"
"centuries. At last a steady twilight brooded over the earth, a twilight"
"only broken now and then when a comet glared across the darkling sky."
"The band of light that had indicated the sun had long since"
"disappeared; for the sun had ceased to set—it simply rose and fell in"
"the west, and grew ever broader and more red. All trace of the moon had"
"vanished. The circling of the stars, growing slower and slower, had"
"given place to creeping points of light. At last, some time before I"
"stopped, the sun, red and very large, halted motionless upon the"
"horizon, a vast dome glowing with a dull heat, and now and then"
"suffering a momentary extinction. At one time it had for a little while"
"glowed more brilliantly again, but it speedily reverted to its sullen"
"red heat. I perceived by this slowing down of its rising and setting"
"that the work of the tidal drag was done. The earth had come to rest"
"with one face to the sun, even as in our own time the moon faces the"
"earth. Very cautiously, for I remembered my former headlong fall, I"
"began to reverse my motion. Slower and slower went the circling hands"
"until the thousands one seemed motionless and the daily one was no"
"longer a mere mist upon its scale. Still slower, until the dim outlines"
"of a desolate beach grew visible."
"“I stopped very gently and sat upon the Time Machine, looking round."
"The sky was no longer blue. North-eastward it was inky black, and out"
"of the blackness shone brightly and steadily the pale white stars."
"Overhead it was a deep Indian red and starless, and south-eastward it"
"grew brighter to a glowing scarlet where, cut by the horizon, lay the"
"huge hull of the sun, red and motionless. The rocks about me were of a"
"harsh reddish colour, and all the trace of life that I could see at"
"first was the intensely green vegetation that covered every projecting"
"point on their south-eastern face. It was the same rich green that one"
"sees on forest moss or on the lichen in caves: plants which like these"
"grow in a perpetual twilight."
"“The machine was standing on a sloping beach. The sea stretched away to"
"the south-west, to rise into a sharp bright horizon against the wan"
"sky. There were no breakers and no waves, for not a breath of wind was"
"stirring. Only a slight oily swell rose and fell like a gentle"
"breathing, and showed that the eternal sea was still moving and living."
"And along the margin where the water sometimes broke was a thick"
"incrustation of salt—pink under the lurid sky. There was a sense of"
"oppression in my head, and I noticed that I was breathing very fast."
"The sensation reminded me of my only experience of mountaineering, and"
"from that I judged the air to be more rarefied than it is now."
"“Far away up the desolate slope I heard a harsh scream, and saw a thing"
"like a huge white butterfly go slanting and fluttering up into the sky"
"and, circling, disappear over some low hillocks beyond. The sound of"
"its voice was so dismal that I shivered and seated myself more firmly"
"upon the machine. Looking round me again, I saw that, quite near, what"
"I had taken to be a reddish mass of rock was moving slowly towards me."
"Then I saw the thing was really a monstrous crab-like creature. Can you"
"imagine a crab as large as yonder table, with its many legs moving"
"slowly and uncertainly, its big claws swaying, its long antennæ, like"
"carters’ whips, waving and feeling, and its stalked eyes gleaming at"
"you on either side of its metallic front? Its back was corrugated and"
"ornamented with ungainly bosses, and a greenish incrustation blotched"
"it here and there. I could see the many palps of its complicated mouth"
"flickering and feeling as it moved."
"“As I stared at this sinister apparition crawling towards me, I felt a"
"tickling on my cheek as though a fly had lighted there. I tried to"
"brush it away with my hand, but in a moment it returned, and almost"
"immediately came another by my ear. I struck at this, and caught"
"something threadlike. It was drawn swiftly out of my hand. With a"
"frightful qualm, I turned, and I saw that I had grasped the antenna of"
"another monster crab that stood just behind me. Its evil eyes were"
"wriggling on their stalks, its mouth was all alive with appetite, and"
"its vast ungainly claws, smeared with an algal slime, were descending"
"upon me. In a moment my hand was on the lever, and I had placed a month"
"between myself and these monsters. But I was still on the same beach,"
"and I saw them distinctly now as soon as I stopped. Dozens of them"
"seemed to be crawling here and there, in the sombre light, among the"
"foliated sheets of intense green."
"“I cannot convey the sense of abominable desolation that hung over the"
"world. The red eastern sky, the northward blackness, the salt Dead Sea,"
"the stony beach crawling with these foul, slow-stirring monsters, the"
"uniform poisonous-looking green of the lichenous plants, the thin air"
"that hurts one’s lungs: all contributed to an appalling effect. I moved"
"on a hundred years, and there was the same red sun—a little larger, a"
"little duller—the same dying sea, the same chill air, and the same"
"crowd of earthy crustacea creeping in and out among the green weed and"
"the red rocks. And in the westward sky, I saw a curved pale line like a"
"vast new moon."
"“So I travelled, stopping ever and again, in great strides of a"
"thousand years or more, drawn on by the mystery of the earth’s fate,"
"watching with a strange fascination the sun grow larger and duller in"
"the westward sky, and the life of the old earth ebb away. At last, more"
"than thirty million years hence, the huge red-hot dome of the sun had"
"come to obscure nearly a tenth part of the darkling heavens. Then I"
"stopped once more, for the crawling multitude of crabs had disappeared,"
"and the red beach, save for its livid green liverworts and lichens,"
"seemed lifeless. And now it was flecked with white. A bitter cold"
"assailed me. Rare white flakes ever and again came eddying down. To the"
"north-eastward, the glare of snow lay under the starlight of the sable"
"sky, and I could see an undulating crest of hillocks pinkish white."
"There were fringes of ice along the sea margin, with drifting masses"
"farther out; but the main expanse of that salt ocean, all bloody under"
"the eternal sunset, was still unfrozen."
"“I looked about me to see if any traces of animal life remained. A"
"certain indefinable apprehension still kept me in the saddle of the"
"machine. But I saw nothing moving, in earth or sky or sea. The green"
"slime on the rocks alone testified that life was not extinct. A shallow"
"sandbank had appeared in the sea and the water had receded from the"
"beach. I fancied I saw some black object flopping about upon this bank,"
"but it became motionless as I looked at it, and I judged that my eye"
"had been deceived, and that the black object was merely a rock. The"
"stars in the sky were intensely bright and seemed to me to twinkle very"
"little."
"“Suddenly I noticed that the circular westward outline of the sun had"
"changed; that a concavity, a bay, had appeared in the curve. I saw this"
"grow larger. For a minute perhaps I stared aghast at this blackness"
"that was creeping over the day, and then I realised that an eclipse was"
"beginning. Either the moon or the planet Mercury was passing across the"
"sun’s disk. Naturally, at first I took it to be the moon, but there is"
"much to incline me to believe that what I really saw was the transit of"
"an inner planet passing very near to the earth."
"“The darkness grew apace; a cold wind began to blow in freshening gusts"
"from the east, and the showering white flakes in the air increased in"
"number. From the edge of the sea came a ripple and whisper. Beyond"
"these lifeless sounds the world was silent. Silent? It would be hard to"
"convey the stillness of it. All the sounds of man, the bleating of"
"sheep, the cries of birds, the hum of insects, the stir that makes the"
"background of our lives—all that was over. As the darkness thickened,"
"the eddying flakes grew more abundant, dancing before my eyes; and the"
"cold of the air more intense. At last, one by one, swiftly, one after"
"the other, the white peaks of the distant hills vanished into"
"blackness. The breeze rose to a moaning wind. I saw the black central"
"shadow of the eclipse sweeping towards me. In another moment the pale"
"stars alone were visible. All else was rayless obscurity. The sky was"
"absolutely black."
"“A horror of this great darkness came on me. The cold, that smote to my"
"marrow, and the pain I felt in breathing, overcame me. I shivered, and"
"a deadly nausea seized me. Then like a red-hot bow in the sky appeared"
"the edge of the sun. I got off the machine to recover myself. I felt"
"giddy and incapable of facing the return journey. As I stood sick and"
"confused I saw again the moving thing upon the shoal—there was no"
"mistake now that it was a moving thing—against the red water of the"
"sea. It was a round thing, the size of a football perhaps, or, it may"
"be, bigger, and tentacles trailed down from it; it seemed black against"
"the weltering blood-red water, and it was hopping fitfully about. Then"
"I felt I was fainting. But a terrible dread of lying helpless in that"
"remote and awful twilight sustained me while I clambered upon the"
"saddle."
" The Time Traveller’s Return"
"“So I came back. For a long time I must have been insensible upon the"
"machine. The blinking succession of the days and nights was resumed,"
"the sun got golden again, the sky blue. I breathed with greater"
"freedom. The fluctuating contours of the land ebbed and flowed. The"
"hands spun backward upon the dials. At last I saw again the dim shadows"
"of houses, the evidences of decadent humanity. These, too, changed and"
"passed, and others came. Presently, when the million dial was at zero,"
"I slackened speed. I began to recognise our own pretty and familiar"
"architecture, the thousands hand ran back to the starting-point, the"
"night and day flapped slower and slower. Then the old walls of the"
"laboratory came round me. Very gently, now, I slowed the mechanism"
"down."
"“I saw one little thing that seemed odd to me. I think I have told you"
"that when I set out, before my velocity became very high, Mrs. Watchett"
"had walked across the room, travelling, as it seemed to me, like a"
"rocket. As I returned, I passed again across that minute when she"
"traversed the laboratory. But now her every motion appeared to be the"
"exact inversion of her previous ones. The door at the lower end opened,"
"and she glided quietly up the laboratory, back foremost, and"
"disappeared behind the door by which she had previously entered. Just"
"before that I seemed to see Hillyer for a moment; but he passed like a"
"flash."
"“Then I stopped the machine, and saw about me again the old familiar"
"laboratory, my tools, my appliances just as I had left them. I got off"
"the thing very shakily, and sat down upon my bench. For several minutes"
"I trembled violently. Then I became calmer. Around me was my old"
"workshop again, exactly as it had been. I might have slept there, and"
"the whole thing have been a dream."
"“And yet, not exactly! The thing had started from the south-east corner"
"of the laboratory. It had come to rest again in the north-west, against"
"the wall where you saw it. That gives you the exact distance from my"
"little lawn to the pedestal of the White Sphinx, into which the"
"Morlocks had carried my machine."
"“For a time my brain went stagnant. Presently I got up and came through"
"the passage here, limping, because my heel was still painful, and"
"feeling sorely begrimed. I saw the _Pall Mall Gazette_ on the table by"
"the door. I found the date was indeed today, and looking at the"
"timepiece, saw the hour was almost eight o’clock. I heard your voices"
"and the clatter of plates. I hesitated—I felt so sick and weak. Then I"
"sniffed good wholesome meat, and opened the door on you. You know the"
"rest. I washed, and dined, and now I am telling you the story."
" After the Story"
"“I know,” he said, after a pause, “that all this will be absolutely"
"incredible to you, but to me the one incredible thing is that I am here"
"tonight in this old familiar room looking into your friendly faces and"
"telling you these strange adventures.” He looked at the Medical Man."
"“No. I cannot expect you to believe it. Take it as a lie—or a prophecy."
"Say I dreamed it in the workshop. Consider I have been speculating upon"
"the destinies of our race, until I have hatched this fiction. Treat my"
"assertion of its truth as a mere stroke of art to enhance its interest."
"And taking it as a story, what do you think of it?”"
"He took up his pipe, and began, in his old accustomed manner, to tap"
"with it nervously upon the bars of the grate. There was a momentary"
"stillness. Then chairs began to creak and shoes to scrape upon the"
"carpet. I took my eyes off the Time Traveller’s face, and looked round"
"at his audience. They were in the dark, and little spots of colour swam"
"before them. The Medical Man seemed absorbed in the contemplation of"
"our host. The Editor was looking hard at the end of his cigar—the"
"sixth. The Journalist fumbled for his watch. The others, as far as I"
"remember, were motionless."
"The Editor stood up with a sigh. “What a pity it is you’re not a writer"
"of stories!” he said, putting his hand on the Time Traveller’s"
"shoulder."
"“You don’t believe it?”"
"“Well——”"
"“I thought not.”"
"The Time Traveller turned to us. “Where are the matches?” he said. He"
"lit one and spoke over his pipe, puffing. “To tell you the truth... I"
"hardly believe it myself..... And yet...”"
"His eye fell with a mute inquiry upon the withered white flowers upon"
"the little table. Then he turned over the hand holding his pipe, and I"
"saw he was looking at some half-healed scars on his knuckles."
"The Medical Man rose, came to the lamp, and examined the flowers. “The"
"gynæceum’s odd,” he said. The Psychologist leant forward to see,"
"holding out his hand for a specimen."
"“I’m hanged if it isn’t a quarter to one,” said the Journalist. “How"
"shall we get home?”"
"“Plenty of cabs at the station,” said the Psychologist."
"“It’s a curious thing,” said the Medical Man; “but I certainly don’t"
"know the natural order of these flowers. May I have them?”"
"The Time Traveller hesitated. Then suddenly: “Certainly not.”"
"“Where did you really get them?” said the Medical Man."
"The Time Traveller put his hand to his head. He spoke like one who was"
"trying to keep hold of an idea that eluded him. “They were put into my"
"pocket by Weena, when I travelled into Time.” He stared round the room."
"“I’m damned if it isn’t all going. This room and you and the atmosphere"
"of every day is too much for my memory. Did I ever make a Time Machine,"
"or a model of a Time Machine? Or is it all only a dream? They say life"
"is a dream, a precious poor dream at times—but I can’t stand another"
"that won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream come from? … I"
"must look at that machine. If there is one!”"
"He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the"
"door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light"
"of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a"
"thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid"
"to the touch—for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with"
"brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon"
"the lower parts, and one rail bent awry."
"The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand"
"along the damaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said. “The story I"
"told you was true. I’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.”"
"He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the"
"smoking-room."
"He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat."
"The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation,"
"told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I"
"remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night."
"I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a “gaudy lie.” For"
"my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so"
"fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay"
"awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day"
"and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory,"
"and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,"
"however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put"
"out my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat"
"substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its"
"instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of"
"the childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back"
"through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He"
"was coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a"
"knapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an"
"elbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “with that thing in"
"there.”"
"“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”"
"“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He"
"hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,”"
"he said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s"
"some magazines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you this time"
"travelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll forgive my"
"leaving you now?”"
"I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,"
"and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the"
"laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper."
"What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded"
"by an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the"
"publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely"
"save that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the"
"Time Traveller."
"As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly"
"truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled"
"round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken"
"glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed"
"to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black"
"and brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind"
"with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm"
"vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a"
"subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A"
"pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in."
"I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had"
"happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange"
"thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,"
"and the man-servant appeared."
"We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr. —— gone out"
"that way?” said I."
"“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him"
"here.”"
"At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed"
"on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps"
"still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring"
"with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime."
"The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows"
"now, he has never returned."
" Epilogue"
"One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he"
"swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy"
"savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the"
"Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian"
"brutes of the Jurassic times. He may even now—if I may use the"
"phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or"
"beside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go"
"forward, into one of the nearer ages, in which men are still men, but"
"with the riddles of our own time answered and its wearisome problems"
"solved? Into the manhood of the race: for I, for my own part, cannot"
"think that these latter days of weak experiment, fragmentary theory,"
"and mutual discord are indeed man’s culminating time! I say, for my own"
"part. He, I know—for the question had been discussed among us long"
"before the Time Machine was made—thought but cheerlessly of the"
"Advancement of Mankind, and saw in the growing pile of civilisation"
"only a foolish heaping that must inevitably fall back upon and destroy"
"its makers in the end. If that is so, it remains for us to live as"
"though it were not so. But to me the future is still black and blank—is"
"a vast ignorance, lit at a few casual places by the memory of his"
"story. And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white"
"flowers—shrivelled now, and brown and flat and brittle—to witness that"
"even when mind and strength had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness"
"still lived on in the heart of man."

"BOOK ONE"
"THE COMING OF THE MARTIANS"
"I."
"THE EVE OF THE WAR."
"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century"
"that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences"
"greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied"
"themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and"
"studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might"
"scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of"
"water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe"
"about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire"
"over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do"
"the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources"
"of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life"
"upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of"
"the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men"
"fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to"
"themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the"
"gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the"
"beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,"
"regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their"
"plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great"
"disillusionment."
"The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the"
"sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it"
"receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It"
"must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;"
"and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface"
"must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of"
"the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the"
"temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all"
"that is necessary for the support of animated existence."
"Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to"
"the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that"
"intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,"
"beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since"
"Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the"
"superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that"
"it is not only more distant from time’s beginning but nearer its end."
"The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already"
"gone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still"
"largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region"
"the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter."
"Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until"
"they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change"
"huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically"
"inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to"
"us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the"
"inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened"
"their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And"
"looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we"
"have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only"
"35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own"
"warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy"
"atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting"
"cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow,"
"navy-crowded seas."
"And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at"
"least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The"
"intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant"
"struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief"
"of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this"
"world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they"
"regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their"
"only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation,"
"creeps upon them."
"And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless"
"and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon"
"animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior"
"races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely"
"swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European"
"immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy"
"as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?"
"The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing"
"subtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of"
"ours—and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh"
"perfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen"
"the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like"
"Schiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd, by-the-bye, that for"
"countless centuries Mars has been the star of war—but failed to"
"interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so"
"well. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready."
"During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated"
"part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of"
"Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in"
"the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this"
"blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk"
"into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar"
"markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak"
"during the next two oppositions."
"The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached"
"opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange"
"palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of"
"incandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of"
"the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,"
"indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an"
"enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become"
"invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal"
"puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, “as"
"flaming gases rushed out of a gun.”"
"A singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was"
"nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily"
"Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest"
"dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of"
"the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at"
"Ottershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of"
"his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a"
"scrutiny of the red planet."
"In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil"
"very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern"
"throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking"
"of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof—an"
"oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved"
"about, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a"
"circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field."
"It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly"
"marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect"
"round. But so little it was, so silvery warm—a pin’s head of light! It"
"was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with"
"the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view."
"As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to"
"advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty"
"millions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of"
"void. Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of"
"the material universe swims."
"Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,"
"three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the"
"unfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks"
"on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder."
"And invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly"
"and steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer"
"every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were"
"sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity"
"and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one"
"on earth dreamed of that unerring missile."
"That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant"
"planet. I saw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection"
"of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I"
"told Ogilvy and he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty,"
"and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the"
"darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy"
"exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us."
"That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth"
"from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first"
"one. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with"
"patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a"
"light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I"
"had seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till"
"one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his"
"house. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all"
"their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace."
"He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and"
"scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were"
"signalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy"
"shower upon the planet, or that a huge volcanic explosion was in"
"progress. He pointed out to me how unlikely it was that organic"
"evolution had taken the same direction in the two adjacent planets."
"“The chances against anything manlike on Mars are a million to one,” he"
"said."
"Hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after"
"about midnight, and again the night after; and so for ten nights, a"
"flame each night. Why the shots ceased after the tenth no one on earth"
"has attempted to explain. It may be the gases of the firing caused the"
"Martians inconvenience. Dense clouds of smoke or dust, visible through"
"a powerful telescope on earth as little grey, fluctuating patches,"
"spread through the clearness of the planet’s atmosphere and obscured"
"its more familiar features."
"Even the daily papers woke up to the disturbances at last, and popular"
"notes appeared here, there, and everywhere concerning the volcanoes"
"upon Mars. The seriocomic periodical _Punch_, I remember, made a happy"
"use of it in the political cartoon. And, all unsuspected, those"
"missiles the Martians had fired at us drew earthward, rushing now at a"
"pace of many miles a second through the empty gulf of space, hour by"
"hour and day by day, nearer and nearer. It seems to me now almost"
"incredibly wonderful that, with that swift fate hanging over us, men"
"could go about their petty concerns as they did. I remember how"
"jubilant Markham was at securing a new photograph of the planet for the"
"illustrated paper he edited in those days. People in these latter times"
"scarcely realise the abundance and enterprise of our nineteenth-century"
"papers. For my own part, I was much occupied in learning to ride the"
"bicycle, and busy upon a series of papers discussing the probable"
"developments of moral ideas as civilisation progressed."
"One night (the first missile then could scarcely have been 10,000,000"
"miles away) I went for a walk with my wife. It was starlight and I"
"explained the Signs of the Zodiac to her, and pointed out Mars, a"
"bright dot of light creeping zenithward, towards which so many"
"telescopes were pointed. It was a warm night. Coming home, a party of"
"excursionists from Chertsey or Isleworth passed us singing and playing"
"music. There were lights in the upper windows of the houses as the"
"people went to bed. From the railway station in the distance came the"
"sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into"
"melody by the distance. My wife pointed out to me the brightness of the"
"red, green, and yellow signal lights hanging in a framework against the"
"sky. It seemed so safe and tranquil."
"II."
"THE FALLING STAR."
"Then came the night of the first falling star. It was seen early in the"
"morning, rushing over Winchester eastward, a line of flame high in the"
"atmosphere. Hundreds must have seen it, and taken it for an ordinary"
"falling star. Albin described it as leaving a greenish streak behind it"
"that glowed for some seconds. Denning, our greatest authority on"
"meteorites, stated that the height of its first appearance was about"
"ninety or one hundred miles. It seemed to him that it fell to earth"
"about one hundred miles east of him."
"I was at home at that hour and writing in my study; and although my"
"French windows face towards Ottershaw and the blind was up (for I loved"
"in those days to look up at the night sky), I saw nothing of it. Yet"
"this strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space"
"must have fallen while I was sitting there, visible to me had I only"
"looked up as it passed. Some of those who saw its flight say it"
"travelled with a hissing sound. I myself heard nothing of that. Many"
"people in Berkshire, Surrey, and Middlesex must have seen the fall of"
"it, and, at most, have thought that another meteorite had descended. No"
"one seems to have troubled to look for the fallen mass that night."
"But very early in the morning poor Ogilvy, who had seen the shooting"
"star and who was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere on the common"
"between Horsell, Ottershaw, and Woking, rose early with the idea of"
"finding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the"
"sand-pits. An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the"
"projectile, and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every"
"direction over the heath, forming heaps visible a mile and a half away."
"The heather was on fire eastward, and a thin blue smoke rose against"
"the dawn."
"The Thing itself lay almost entirely buried in sand, amidst the"
"scattered splinters of a fir tree it had shivered to fragments in its"
"descent. The uncovered part had the appearance of a huge cylinder,"
"caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured"
"incrustation. It had a diameter of about thirty yards. He approached"
"the mass, surprised at the size and more so at the shape, since most"
"meteorites are rounded more or less completely. It was, however, still"
"so hot from its flight through the air as to forbid his near approach."
"A stirring noise within its cylinder he ascribed to the unequal cooling"
"of its surface; for at that time it had not occurred to him that it"
"might be hollow."
"He remained standing at the edge of the pit that the Thing had made for"
"itself, staring at its strange appearance, astonished chiefly at its"
"unusual shape and colour, and dimly perceiving even then some evidence"
"of design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and"
"the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already"
"warm. He did not remember hearing any birds that morning, there was"
"certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint"
"movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the"
"common."
"Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker,"
"the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the"
"circular edge of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining"
"down upon the sand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a"
"sharp noise that brought his heart into his mouth."
"For a minute he scarcely realised what this meant, and, although the"
"heat was excessive, he clambered down into the pit close to the bulk to"
"see the Thing more clearly. He fancied even then that the cooling of"
"the body might account for this, but what disturbed that idea was the"
"fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder."
"And then he perceived that, very slowly, the circular top of the"
"cylinder was rotating on its body. It was such a gradual movement that"
"he discovered it only through noticing that a black mark that had been"
"near him five minutes ago was now at the other side of the"
"circumference. Even then he scarcely understood what this indicated,"
"until he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk"
"forward an inch or so. Then the thing came upon him in a flash. The"
"cylinder was artificial—hollow—with an end that screwed out! Something"
"within the cylinder was unscrewing the top!"
"“Good heavens!” said Ogilvy. “There’s a man in it—men in it! Half"
"roasted to death! Trying to escape!”"
"At once, with a quick mental leap, he linked the Thing with the flash"
"upon Mars."
"The thought of the confined creature was so dreadful to him that he"
"forgot the heat and went forward to the cylinder to help turn. But"
"luckily the dull radiation arrested him before he could burn his hands"
"on the still-glowing metal. At that he stood irresolute for a moment,"
"then turned, scrambled out of the pit, and set off running wildly into"
"Woking. The time then must have been somewhere about six o’clock. He"
"met a waggoner and tried to make him understand, but the tale he told"
"and his appearance were so wild—his hat had fallen off in the pit—that"
"the man simply drove on. He was equally unsuccessful with the potman"
"who was just unlocking the doors of the public-house by Horsell Bridge."
"The fellow thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful"
"attempt to shut him into the taproom. That sobered him a little; and"
"when he saw Henderson, the London journalist, in his garden, he called"
"over the palings and made himself understood."
"“Henderson,” he called, “you saw that shooting star last night?”"
"“Well?” said Henderson."
"“It’s out on Horsell Common now.”"
"“Good Lord!” said Henderson. “Fallen meteorite! That’s good.”"
"“But it’s something more than a meteorite. It’s a cylinder—an"
"artificial cylinder, man! And there’s something inside.”"
"Henderson stood up with his spade in his hand."
"“What’s that?” he said. He was deaf in one ear."
"Ogilvy told him all that he had seen. Henderson was a minute or so"
"taking it in. Then he dropped his spade, snatched up his jacket, and"
"came out into the road. The two men hurried back at once to the common,"
"and found the cylinder still lying in the same position. But now the"
"sounds inside had ceased, and a thin circle of bright metal showed"
"between the top and the body of the cylinder. Air was either entering"
"or escaping at the rim with a thin, sizzling sound."
"They listened, rapped on the scaly burnt metal with a stick, and,"
"meeting with no response, they both concluded the man or men inside"
"must be insensible or dead."
"Of course the two were quite unable to do anything. They shouted"
"consolation and promises, and went off back to the town again to get"
"help. One can imagine them, covered with sand, excited and disordered,"
"running up the little street in the bright sunlight just as the shop"
"folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their"
"bedroom windows. Henderson went into the railway station at once, in"
"order to telegraph the news to London. The newspaper articles had"
"prepared men’s minds for the reception of the idea."
"By eight o’clock a number of boys and unemployed men had already"
"started for the common to see the “dead men from Mars.” That was the"
"form the story took. I heard of it first from my newspaper boy about a"
"quarter to nine when I went out to get my _Daily Chronicle_. I was"
"naturally startled, and lost no time in going out and across the"
"Ottershaw bridge to the sand-pits."
"III."
"ON HORSELL COMMON."
"I found a little crowd of perhaps twenty people surrounding the huge"
"hole in which the cylinder lay. I have already described the appearance"
"of that colossal bulk, embedded in the ground. The turf and gravel"
"about it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion. No doubt its"
"impact had caused a flash of fire. Henderson and Ogilvy were not there."
"I think they perceived that nothing was to be done for the present, and"
"had gone away to breakfast at Henderson’s house."
"There were four or five boys sitting on the edge of the Pit, with their"
"feet dangling, and amusing themselves—until I stopped them—by throwing"
"stones at the giant mass. After I had spoken to them about it, they"
"began playing at “touch” in and out of the group of bystanders."
"Among these were a couple of cyclists, a jobbing gardener I employed"
"sometimes, a girl carrying a baby, Gregg the butcher and his little"
"boy, and two or three loafers and golf caddies who were accustomed to"
"hang about the railway station. There was very little talking. Few of"
"the common people in England had anything but the vaguest astronomical"
"ideas in those days. Most of them were staring quietly at the big table"
"like end of the cylinder, which was still as Ogilvy and Henderson had"
"left it. I fancy the popular expectation of a heap of charred corpses"
"was disappointed at this inanimate bulk. Some went away while I was"
"there, and other people came. I clambered into the pit and fancied I"
"heard a faint movement under my feet. The top had certainly ceased to"
"rotate."
"It was only when I got thus close to it that the strangeness of this"
"object was at all evident to me. At the first glance it was really no"
"more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the"
"road. Not so much so, indeed. It looked like a rusty gas float. It"
"required a certain amount of scientific education to perceive that the"
"grey scale of the Thing was no common oxide, that the yellowish-white"
"metal that gleamed in the crack between the lid and the cylinder had an"
"unfamiliar hue. “Extra-terrestrial” had no meaning for most of the"
"onlookers."
"At that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the Thing had come"
"from the planet Mars, but I judged it improbable that it contained any"
"living creature. I thought the unscrewing might be automatic. In spite"
"of Ogilvy, I still believed that there were men in Mars. My mind ran"
"fancifully on the possibilities of its containing manuscript, on the"
"difficulties in translation that might arise, whether we should find"
"coins and models in it, and so forth. Yet it was a little too large for"
"assurance on this idea. I felt an impatience to see it opened. About"
"eleven, as nothing seemed happening, I walked back, full of such"
"thought, to my home in Maybury. But I found it difficult to get to work"
"upon my abstract investigations."
"In the afternoon the appearance of the common had altered very much."
"The early editions of the evening papers had startled London with"
"enormous headlines:"
"“A MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM MARS.”"
"“REMARKABLE STORY FROM WOKING,”"
"and so forth. In addition, Ogilvy’s wire to the Astronomical Exchange"
"had roused every observatory in the three kingdoms."
"There were half a dozen flys or more from the Woking station standing"
"in the road by the sand-pits, a basket-chaise from Chobham, and a"
"rather lordly carriage. Besides that, there was quite a heap of"
"bicycles. In addition, a large number of people must have walked, in"
"spite of the heat of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there"
"was altogether quite a considerable crowd—one or two gaily dressed"
"ladies among the others."
"It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and"
"the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning"
"heather had been extinguished, but the level ground towards Ottershaw"
"was blackened as far as one could see, and still giving off vertical"
"streamers of smoke. An enterprising sweet-stuff dealer in the Chobham"
"Road had sent up his son with a barrow-load of green apples and ginger"
"beer."
"Going to the edge of the pit, I found it occupied by a group of about"
"half a dozen men—Henderson, Ogilvy, and a tall, fair-haired man that I"
"afterwards learned was Stent, the Astronomer Royal, with several"
"workmen wielding spades and pickaxes. Stent was giving directions in a"
"clear, high-pitched voice. He was standing on the cylinder, which was"
"now evidently much cooler; his face was crimson and streaming with"
"perspiration, and something seemed to have irritated him."
"A large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered, though its lower"
"end was still embedded. As soon as Ogilvy saw me among the staring"
"crowd on the edge of the pit he called to me to come down, and asked me"
"if I would mind going over to see Lord Hilton, the lord of the manor."
"The growing crowd, he said, was becoming a serious impediment to their"
"excavations, especially the boys. They wanted a light railing put up,"
"and help to keep the people back. He told me that a faint stirring was"
"occasionally still audible within the case, but that the workmen had"
"failed to unscrew the top, as it afforded no grip to them. The case"
"appeared to be enormously thick, and it was possible that the faint"
"sounds we heard represented a noisy tumult in the interior."
"I was very glad to do as he asked, and so become one of the privileged"
"spectators within the contemplated enclosure. I failed to find Lord"
"Hilton at his house, but I was told he was expected from London by the"
"six o’clock train from Waterloo; and as it was then about a quarter"
"past five, I went home, had some tea, and walked up to the station to"
"waylay him."
"IV."
"THE CYLINDER OPENS."
"When I returned to the common the sun was setting. Scattered groups"
"were hurrying from the direction of Woking, and one or two persons were"
"returning. The crowd about the pit had increased, and stood out black"
"against the lemon yellow of the sky—a couple of hundred people,"
"perhaps. There were raised voices, and some sort of struggle appeared"
"to be going on about the pit. Strange imaginings passed through my"
"mind. As I drew nearer I heard Stent’s voice:"
"“Keep back! Keep back!”"
"A boy came running towards me."
"“It’s a-movin’,” he said to me as he passed; “a-screwin’ and a-screwin’"
"out. I don’t like it. I’m a-goin’ ’ome, I am.”"
"I went on to the crowd. There were really, I should think, two or three"
"hundred people elbowing and jostling one another, the one or two ladies"
"there being by no means the least active."
"“He’s fallen in the pit!” cried some one."
"“Keep back!” said several."
"The crowd swayed a little, and I elbowed my way through. Every one"
"seemed greatly excited. I heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit."
"“I say!” said Ogilvy; “help keep these idiots back. We don’t know"
"what’s in the confounded thing, you know!”"
"I saw a young man, a shop assistant in Woking I believe he was,"
"standing on the cylinder and trying to scramble out of the hole again."
"The crowd had pushed him in."
"The end of the cylinder was being screwed out from within. Nearly two"
"feet of shining screw projected. Somebody blundered against me, and I"
"narrowly missed being pitched onto the top of the screw. I turned, and"
"as I did so the screw must have come out, for the lid of the cylinder"
"fell upon the gravel with a ringing concussion. I stuck my elbow into"
"the person behind me, and turned my head towards the Thing again. For a"
"moment that circular cavity seemed perfectly black. I had the sunset in"
"my eyes."
"I think everyone expected to see a man emerge—possibly something a"
"little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. I know I"
"did. But, looking, I presently saw something stirring within the"
"shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two"
"luminous disks—like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey"
"snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the"
"writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me—and then another."
"A sudden chill came over me. There was a loud shriek from a woman"
"behind. I half turned, keeping my eyes fixed upon the cylinder still,"
"from which other tentacles were now projecting, and began pushing my"
"way back from the edge of the pit. I saw astonishment giving place to"
"horror on the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticulate"
"exclamations on all sides. There was a general movement backwards. I"
"saw the shopman struggling still on the edge of the pit. I found myself"
"alone, and saw the people on the other side of the pit running off,"
"Stent among them. I looked again at the cylinder, and ungovernable"
"terror gripped me. I stood petrified and staring."
"A big greyish rounded bulk, the size, perhaps, of a bear, was rising"
"slowly and painfully out of the cylinder. As it bulged up and caught"
"the light, it glistened like wet leather."
"Two large dark-coloured eyes were regarding me steadfastly. The mass"
"that framed them, the head of the thing, was rounded, and had, one"
"might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim"
"of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature"
"heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped"
"the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air."
"Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the"
"strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its"
"pointed upper lip, the absence of brow ridges, the absence of a chin"
"beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth,"
"the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs"
"in a strange atmosphere, the evident heaviness and painfulness of"
"movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth—above"
"all, the extraordinary intensity of the immense eyes—were at once"
"vital, intense, inhuman, crippled and monstrous. There was something"
"fungoid in the oily brown skin, something in the clumsy deliberation of"
"the tedious movements unspeakably nasty. Even at this first encounter,"
"this first glimpse, I was overcome with disgust and dread."
"Suddenly the monster vanished. It had toppled over the brim of the"
"cylinder and fallen into the pit, with a thud like the fall of a great"
"mass of leather. I heard it give a peculiar thick cry, and forthwith"
"another of these creatures appeared darkly in the deep shadow of the"
"aperture."
"I turned and, running madly, made for the first group of trees, perhaps"
"a hundred yards away; but I ran slantingly and stumbling, for I could"
"not avert my face from these things."
"There, among some young pine trees and furze bushes, I stopped,"
"panting, and waited further developments. The common round the"
"sand-pits was dotted with people, standing like myself in a"
"half-fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the"
"heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay. And then, with"
"a renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on"
"the edge of the pit. It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in,"
"but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun. Now"
"he got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until"
"only his head was visible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have"
"fancied a faint shriek had reached me. I had a momentary impulse to go"
"back and help him that my fears overruled."
"Everything was then quite invisible, hidden by the deep pit and the"
"heap of sand that the fall of the cylinder had made. Anyone coming"
"along the road from Chobham or Woking would have been amazed at the"
"sight—a dwindling multitude of perhaps a hundred people or more"
"standing in a great irregular circle, in ditches, behind bushes, behind"
"gates and hedges, saying little to one another and that in short,"
"excited shouts, and staring, staring hard at a few heaps of sand. The"
"barrow of ginger beer stood, a queer derelict, black against the"
"burning sky, and in the sand-pits was a row of deserted vehicles with"
"their horses feeding out of nosebags or pawing the ground."
"V."
"THE HEAT-RAY."
"After the glimpse I had had of the Martians emerging from the cylinder"
"in which they had come to the earth from their planet, a kind of"
"fascination paralysed my actions. I remained standing knee-deep in the"
"heather, staring at the mound that hid them. I was a battleground of"
"fear and curiosity."
"I did not dare to go back towards the pit, but I felt a passionate"
"longing to peer into it. I began walking, therefore, in a big curve,"
"seeking some point of vantage and continually looking at the sand-heaps"
"that hid these new-comers to our earth. Once a leash of thin black"
"whips, like the arms of an octopus, flashed across the sunset and was"
"immediately withdrawn, and afterwards a thin rod rose up, joint by"
"joint, bearing at its apex a circular disk that spun with a wobbling"
"motion. What could be going on there?"
"Most of the spectators had gathered in one or two groups—one a little"
"crowd towards Woking, the other a knot of people in the direction of"
"Chobham. Evidently they shared my mental conflict. There were few near"
"me. One man I approached—he was, I perceived, a neighbour of mine,"
"though I did not know his name—and accosted. But it was scarcely a time"
"for articulate conversation."
"“What ugly _brutes_!” he said. “Good God! What ugly brutes!” He"
"repeated this over and over again."
"“Did you see a man in the pit?” I said; but he made no answer to that."
"We became silent, and stood watching for a time side by side, deriving,"
"I fancy, a certain comfort in one another’s company. Then I shifted my"
"position to a little knoll that gave me the advantage of a yard or more"
"of elevation and when I looked for him presently he was walking towards"
"Woking."
"The sunset faded to twilight before anything further happened. The"
"crowd far away on the left, towards Woking, seemed to grow, and I heard"
"now a faint murmur from it. The little knot of people towards Chobham"
"dispersed. There was scarcely an intimation of movement from the pit."
"It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I"
"suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence."
"At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the"
"sand-pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the"
"stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken. Vertical"
"black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and"
"advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular"
"crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns. I,"
"too, on my side began to move towards the pit."
"Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand-pits,"
"and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels. I saw a lad"
"trundling off the barrow of apples. And then, within thirty yards of"
"the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little"
"black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag."
"This was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consultation, and since"
"the Martians were evidently, in spite of their repulsive forms,"
"intelligent creatures, it had been resolved to show them, by"
"approaching them with signals, that we too were intelligent."
"Flutter, flutter, went the flag, first to the right, then to the left."
"It was too far for me to recognise anyone there, but afterwards I"
"learned that Ogilvy, Stent, and Henderson were with others in this"
"attempt at communication. This little group had in its advance dragged"
"inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete"
"circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at"
"discreet distances."
"Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous"
"greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove"
"up, one after the other, straight into the still air."
"This smoke (or flame, perhaps, would be the better word for it) was so"
"bright that the deep blue sky overhead and the hazy stretches of brown"
"common towards Chertsey, set with black pine trees, seemed to darken"
"abruptly as these puffs arose, and to remain the darker after their"
"dispersal. At the same time a faint hissing sound became audible."
"Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at"
"its apex, arrested by these phenomena, a little knot of small vertical"
"black shapes upon the black ground. As the green smoke arose, their"
"faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished. Then"
"slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud, droning"
"noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a"
"beam of light seemed to flicker out from it."
"Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to"
"another, sprang from the scattered group of men. It was as if some"
"invisible jet impinged upon them and flashed into white flame. It was"
"as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire."
"Then, by the light of their own destruction, I saw them staggering and"
"falling, and their supporters turning to run."
"I stood staring, not as yet realising that this was death leaping from"
"man to man in that little distant crowd. All I felt was that it was"
"something very strange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash of"
"light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft"
"of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry"
"furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames. And far away"
"towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden"
"buildings suddenly set alight."
"It was sweeping round swiftly and steadily, this flaming death, this"
"invisible, inevitable sword of heat. I perceived it coming towards me"
"by the flashing bushes it touched, and was too astounded and stupefied"
"to stir. I heard the crackle of fire in the sand-pits and the sudden"
"squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an"
"invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather"
"between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the"
"sand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a"
"crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out"
"on the common. Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased, and the"
"black, dome-like object sank slowly out of sight into the pit."
"All this had happened with such swiftness that I had stood motionless,"
"dumbfounded and dazzled by the flashes of light. Had that death swept"
"through a full circle, it must inevitably have slain me in my surprise."
"But it passed and spared me, and left the night about me suddenly dark"
"and unfamiliar."
"The undulating common seemed now dark almost to blackness, except where"
"its roadways lay grey and pale under the deep blue sky of the early"
"night. It was dark, and suddenly void of men. Overhead the stars were"
"mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost"
"greenish blue. The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came"
"out sharp and black against the western afterglow. The Martians and"
"their appliances were altogether invisible, save for that thin mast"
"upon which their restless mirror wobbled. Patches of bush and isolated"
"trees here and there smoked and glowed still, and the houses towards"
"Woking station were sending up spires of flame into the stillness of"
"the evening air."
"Nothing was changed save for that and a terrible astonishment. The"
"little group of black specks with the flag of white had been swept out"
"of existence, and the stillness of the evening, so it seemed to me, had"
"scarcely been broken."
"It came to me that I was upon this dark common, helpless, unprotected,"
"and alone. Suddenly, like a thing falling upon me from without,"
"came—fear."
"With an effort I turned and began a stumbling run through the heather."
"The fear I felt was no rational fear, but a panic terror not only of"
"the Martians, but of the dusk and stillness all about me. Such an"
"extraordinary effect in unmanning me it had that I ran weeping silently"
"as a child might do. Once I had turned, I did not dare to look back."
"I remember I felt an extraordinary persuasion that I was being played"
"with, that presently, when I was upon the very verge of safety, this"
"mysterious death—as swift as the passage of light—would leap after me"
"from the pit about the cylinder, and strike me down."
"VI."
"THE HEAT-RAY IN THE CHOBHAM ROAD."
"It is still a matter of wonder how the Martians are able to slay men so"
"swiftly and so silently. Many think that in some way they are able to"
"generate an intense heat in a chamber of practically absolute"
"non-conductivity. This intense heat they project in a parallel beam"
"against any object they choose, by means of a polished parabolic mirror"
"of unknown composition, much as the parabolic mirror of a lighthouse"
"projects a beam of light. But no one has absolutely proved these"
"details. However it is done, it is certain that a beam of heat is the"
"essence of the matter. Heat, and invisible, instead of visible, light."
"Whatever is combustible flashes into flame at its touch, lead runs like"
"water, it softens iron, cracks and melts glass, and when it falls upon"
"water, incontinently that explodes into steam."
"That night nearly forty people lay under the starlight about the pit,"
"charred and distorted beyond recognition, and all night long the common"
"from Horsell to Maybury was deserted and brightly ablaze."
"The news of the massacre probably reached Chobham, Woking, and"
"Ottershaw about the same time. In Woking the shops had closed when the"
"tragedy happened, and a number of people, shop people and so forth,"
"attracted by the stories they had heard, were walking over the Horsell"
"Bridge and along the road between the hedges that runs out at last upon"
"the common. You may imagine the young people brushed up after the"
"labours of the day, and making this novelty, as they would make any"
"novelty, the excuse for walking together and enjoying a trivial"
"flirtation. You may figure to yourself the hum of voices along the road"
"in the gloaming. . . ."
"As yet, of course, few people in Woking even knew that the cylinder had"
"opened, though poor Henderson had sent a messenger on a bicycle to the"
"post office with a special wire to an evening paper."
"As these folks came out by twos and threes upon the open, they found"
"little knots of people talking excitedly and peering at the spinning"
"mirror over the sand-pits, and the newcomers were, no doubt, soon"
"infected by the excitement of the occasion."
"By half past eight, when the Deputation was destroyed, there may have"
"been a crowd of three hundred people or more at this place, besides"
"those who had left the road to approach the Martians nearer. There were"
"three policemen too, one of whom was mounted, doing their best, under"
"instructions from Stent, to keep the people back and deter them from"
"approaching the cylinder. There was some booing from those more"
"thoughtless and excitable souls to whom a crowd is always an occasion"
"for noise and horse-play."
"Stent and Ogilvy, anticipating some possibilities of a collision, had"
"telegraphed from Horsell to the barracks as soon as the Martians"
"emerged, for the help of a company of soldiers to protect these strange"
"creatures from violence. After that they returned to lead that"
"ill-fated advance. The description of their death, as it was seen by"
"the crowd, tallies very closely with my own impressions: the three"
"puffs of green smoke, the deep humming note, and the flashes of flame."
"But that crowd of people had a far narrower escape than mine. Only the"
"fact that a hummock of heathery sand intercepted the lower part of the"
"Heat-Ray saved them. Had the elevation of the parabolic mirror been a"
"few yards higher, none could have lived to tell the tale. They saw the"
"flashes and the men falling and an invisible hand, as it were, lit the"
"bushes as it hurried towards them through the twilight. Then, with a"
"whistling note that rose above the droning of the pit, the beam swung"
"close over their heads, lighting the tops of the beech trees that line"
"the road, and splitting the bricks, smashing the windows, firing the"
"window frames, and bringing down in crumbling ruin a portion of the"
"gable of the house nearest the corner."
"In the sudden thud, hiss, and glare of the igniting trees, the"
"panic-stricken crowd seems to have swayed hesitatingly for some"
"moments. Sparks and burning twigs began to fall into the road, and"
"single leaves like puffs of flame. Hats and dresses caught fire. Then"
"came a crying from the common. There were shrieks and shouts, and"
"suddenly a mounted policeman came galloping through the confusion with"
"his hands clasped over his head, screaming."
"“They’re coming!” a woman shrieked, and incontinently everyone was"
"turning and pushing at those behind, in order to clear their way to"
"Woking again. They must have bolted as blindly as a flock of sheep."
"Where the road grows narrow and black between the high banks the crowd"
"jammed, and a desperate struggle occurred. All that crowd did not"
"escape; three persons at least, two women and a little boy, were"
"crushed and trampled there, and left to die amid the terror and the"
"darkness."
"VII."
"HOW I REACHED HOME."
"For my own part, I remember nothing of my flight except the stress of"
"blundering against trees and stumbling through the heather. All about"
"me gathered the invisible terrors of the Martians; that pitiless sword"
"of heat seemed whirling to and fro, flourishing overhead before it"
"descended and smote me out of life. I came into the road between the"
"crossroads and Horsell, and ran along this to the crossroads."
"At last I could go no further; I was exhausted with the violence of my"
"emotion and of my flight, and I staggered and fell by the wayside. That"
"was near the bridge that crosses the canal by the gasworks. I fell and"
"lay still."
"I must have remained there some time."
"I sat up, strangely perplexed. For a moment, perhaps, I could not"
"clearly understand how I came there. My terror had fallen from me like"
"a garment. My hat had gone, and my collar had burst away from its"
"fastener. A few minutes before, there had only been three real things"
"before me—the immensity of the night and space and nature, my own"
"feebleness and anguish, and the near approach of death. Now it was as"
"if something turned over, and the point of view altered abruptly. There"
"was no sensible transition from one state of mind to the other. I was"
"immediately the self of every day again—a decent, ordinary citizen. The"
"silent common, the impulse of my flight, the starting flames, were as"
"if they had been in a dream. I asked myself had these latter things"
"indeed happened? I could not credit it."
"I rose and walked unsteadily up the steep incline of the bridge. My"
"mind was blank wonder. My muscles and nerves seemed drained of their"
"strength. I dare say I staggered drunkenly. A head rose over the arch,"
"and the figure of a workman carrying a basket appeared. Beside him ran"
"a little boy. He passed me, wishing me good night. I was minded to"
"speak to him, but did not. I answered his greeting with a meaningless"
"mumble and went on over the bridge."
"Over the Maybury arch a train, a billowing tumult of white, firelit"
"smoke, and a long caterpillar of lighted windows, went flying"
"south—clatter, clatter, clap, rap, and it had gone. A dim group of"
"people talked in the gate of one of the houses in the pretty little row"
"of gables that was called Oriental Terrace. It was all so real and so"
"familiar. And that behind me! It was frantic, fantastic! Such things, I"
"told myself, could not be."
"Perhaps I am a man of exceptional moods. I do not know how far my"
"experience is common. At times I suffer from the strangest sense of"
"detachment from myself and the world about me; I seem to watch it all"
"from the outside, from somewhere inconceivably remote, out of time, out"
"of space, out of the stress and tragedy of it all. This feeling was"
"very strong upon me that night. Here was another side to my dream."
"But the trouble was the blank incongruity of this serenity and the"
"swift death flying yonder, not two miles away. There was a noise of"
"business from the gasworks, and the electric lamps were all alight. I"
"stopped at the group of people."
"“What news from the common?” said I."
"There were two men and a woman at the gate."
"“Eh?” said one of the men, turning."
"“What news from the common?” I said."
"“Ain’t yer just _been_ there?” asked the men."
"“People seem fair silly about the common,” said the woman over the"
"gate. “What’s it all abart?”"
"“Haven’t you heard of the men from Mars?” said I; “the creatures from"
"Mars?”"
"“Quite enough,” said the woman over the gate. “Thenks”; and all three"
"of them laughed."
"I felt foolish and angry. I tried and found I could not tell them what"
"I had seen. They laughed again at my broken sentences."
"“You’ll hear more yet,” I said, and went on to my home."
"I startled my wife at the doorway, so haggard was I. I went into the"
"dining room, sat down, drank some wine, and so soon as I could collect"
"myself sufficiently I told her the things I had seen. The dinner, which"
"was a cold one, had already been served, and remained neglected on the"
"table while I told my story."
"“There is one thing,” I said, to allay the fears I had aroused; “they"
"are the most sluggish things I ever saw crawl. They may keep the pit"
"and kill people who come near them, but they cannot get out of it. . ."
". But the horror of them!”"
"“Don’t, dear!” said my wife, knitting her brows and putting her hand on"
"mine."
"“Poor Ogilvy!” I said. “To think he may be lying dead there!”"
"My wife at least did not find my experience incredible. When I saw how"
"deadly white her face was, I ceased abruptly."
"“They may come here,” she said again and again."
"I pressed her to take wine, and tried to reassure her."
"“They can scarcely move,” I said."
"I began to comfort her and myself by repeating all that Ogilvy had told"
"me of the impossibility of the Martians establishing themselves on the"
"earth. In particular I laid stress on the gravitational difficulty. On"
"the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is"
"on the surface of Mars. A Martian, therefore, would weigh three times"
"more than on Mars, albeit his muscular strength would be the same. His"
"own body would be a cope of lead to him, therefore. That, indeed, was"
"the general opinion. Both _The Times_ and the _Daily Telegraph_, for"
"instance, insisted on it the next morning, and both overlooked, just as"
"I did, two obvious modifying influences."
"The atmosphere of the earth, we now know, contains far more oxygen or"
"far less argon (whichever way one likes to put it) than does Mars’. The"
"invigorating influences of this excess of oxygen upon the Martians"
"indisputably did much to counterbalance the increased weight of their"
"bodies. And, in the second place, we all overlooked the fact that such"
"mechanical intelligence as the Martian possessed was quite able to"
"dispense with muscular exertion at a pinch."
"But I did not consider these points at the time, and so my reasoning"
"was dead against the chances of the invaders. With wine and food, the"
"confidence of my own table, and the necessity of reassuring my wife, I"
"grew by insensible degrees courageous and secure."
"“They have done a foolish thing,” said I, fingering my wineglass. “They"
"are dangerous because, no doubt, they are mad with terror. Perhaps they"
"expected to find no living things—certainly no intelligent living"
"things.”"
"“A shell in the pit,” said I, “if the worst comes to the worst, will"
"kill them all.”"
"The intense excitement of the events had no doubt left my perceptive"
"powers in a state of erethism. I remember that dinner table with"
"extraordinary vividness even now. My dear wife’s sweet anxious face"
"peering at me from under the pink lamp shade, the white cloth with its"
"silver and glass table furniture—for in those days even philosophical"
"writers had many little luxuries—the crimson-purple wine in my glass,"
"are photographically distinct. At the end of it I sat, tempering nuts"
"with a cigarette, regretting Ogilvy’s rashness, and denouncing the"
"short-sighted timidity of the Martians."
"So some respectable dodo in the Mauritius might have lorded it in his"
"nest, and discussed the arrival of that shipful of pitiless sailors in"
"want of animal food. “We will peck them to death tomorrow, my dear.”"
"I did not know it, but that was the last civilised dinner I was to eat"
"for very many strange and terrible days."
"VIII."
"FRIDAY NIGHT."
"The most extraordinary thing to my mind, of all the strange and"
"wonderful things that happened upon that Friday, was the dovetailing of"
"the commonplace habits of our social order with the first beginnings of"
"the series of events that was to topple that social order headlong. If"
"on Friday night you had taken a pair of compasses and drawn a circle"
"with a radius of five miles round the Woking sand-pits, I doubt if you"
"would have had one human being outside it, unless it were some relation"
"of Stent or of the three or four cyclists or London people lying dead"
"on the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the"
"new-comers. Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and"
"talked about it in their leisure, but it certainly did not make the"
"sensation that an ultimatum to Germany would have done."
"In London that night poor Henderson’s telegram describing the gradual"
"unscrewing of the shot was judged to be a canard, and his evening"
"paper, after wiring for authentication from him and receiving no"
"reply—the man was killed—decided not to print a special edition."
"Even within the five-mile circle the great majority of people were"
"inert. I have already described the behaviour of the men and women to"
"whom I spoke. All over the district people were dining and supping;"
"working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were"
"being put to bed, young people were wandering through the lanes"
"love-making, students sat over their books."
"Maybe there was a murmur in the village streets, a novel and dominant"
"topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger, or even an"
"eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a"
"shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily"
"routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done"
"for countless years—as though no planet Mars existed in the sky. Even"
"at Woking station and Horsell and Chobham that was the case."
"In Woking junction, until a late hour, trains were stopping and going"
"on, others were shunting on the sidings, passengers were alighting and"
"waiting, and everything was proceeding in the most ordinary way. A boy"
"from the town, trenching on Smith’s monopoly, was selling papers with"
"the afternoon’s news. The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle"
"of the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of “Men"
"from Mars!” Excited men came into the station about nine o’clock with"
"incredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might"
"have done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside"
"the carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark"
"dance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of"
"smoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious"
"than a heath fire was happening. It was only round the edge of the"
"common that any disturbance was perceptible. There were half a dozen"
"villas burning on the Woking border. There were lights in all the"
"houses on the common side of the three villages, and the people there"
"kept awake till dawn."
"A curious crowd lingered restlessly, people coming and going but the"
"crowd remaining, both on the Chobham and Horsell bridges. One or two"
"adventurous souls, it was afterwards found, went into the darkness and"
"crawled quite near the Martians; but they never returned, for now and"
"again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship’s searchlight swept the"
"common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow. Save for such, that big"
"area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay"
"about on it all night under the stars, and all the next day. A noise of"
"hammering from the pit was heard by many people."
"So you have the state of things on Friday night. In the centre,"
"sticking into the skin of our old planet Earth like a poisoned dart,"
"was this cylinder. But the poison was scarcely working yet. Around it"
"was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few"
"dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there."
"Here and there was a burning bush or tree. Beyond was a fringe of"
"excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept"
"as yet. In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it"
"had flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presently"
"clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to"
"develop."
"All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,"
"indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and"
"ever and again a puff of greenish-white smoke whirled up to the starlit"
"sky."
"About eleven a company of soldiers came through Horsell, and deployed"
"along the edge of the common to form a cordon. Later a second company"
"marched through Chobham to deploy on the north side of the common."
"Several officers from the Inkerman barracks had been on the common"
"earlier in the day, and one, Major Eden, was reported to be missing."
"The colonel of the regiment came to the Chobham bridge and was busy"
"questioning the crowd at midnight. The military authorities were"
"certainly alive to the seriousness of the business. About eleven, the"
"next morning’s papers were able to say, a squadron of hussars, two"
"Maxims, and about four hundred men of the Cardigan regiment started"
"from Aldershot."
"A few seconds after midnight the crowd in the Chertsey road, Woking,"
"saw a star fall from heaven into the pine woods to the northwest. It"
"had a greenish colour, and caused a silent brightness like summer"
"lightning. This was the second cylinder."
"IX."
"THE FIGHTING BEGINS."
"Saturday lives in my memory as a day of suspense. It was a day of"
"lassitude too, hot and close, with, I am told, a rapidly fluctuating"
"barometer. I had slept but little, though my wife had succeeded in"
"sleeping, and I rose early. I went into my garden before breakfast and"
"stood listening, but towards the common there was nothing stirring but"
"a lark."
"The milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went"
"round to the side gate to ask the latest news. He told me that during"
"the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns"
"were expected. Then—a familiar, reassuring note—I heard a train running"
"towards Woking."
"“They aren’t to be killed,” said the milkman, “if that can possibly be"
"avoided.”"
"I saw my neighbour gardening, chatted with him for a time, and then"
"strolled in to breakfast. It was a most unexceptional morning. My"
"neighbour was of opinion that the troops would be able to capture or to"
"destroy the Martians during the day."
"“It’s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,” he said. “It"
"would be curious to know how they live on another planet; we might"
"learn a thing or two.”"
"He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for his"
"gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he"
"told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links."
"“They say,” said he, “that there’s another of those blessed things"
"fallen there—number two. But one’s enough, surely. This lot’ll cost the"
"insurance people a pretty penny before everything’s settled.” He"
"laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this. The"
"woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to"
"me. “They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil"
"of pine needles and turf,” he said, and then grew serious over “poor"
"Ogilvy.”"
"After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards the"
"common. Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers—sappers, I"
"think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and"
"showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf."
"They told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the"
"road towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing"
"sentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them of"
"my sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had seen"
"the Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that they"
"plied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had"
"authorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute"
"had arisen at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal"
"better educated than the common soldier, and they discussed the"
"peculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness. I"
"described the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue among"
"themselves."
"“Crawl up under cover and rush ’em, say I,” said one."
"“Get aht!” said another. “What’s cover against this ’ere ’eat? Sticks"
"to cook yer! What we got to do is to go as near as the ground’ll let"
"us, and then drive a trench.”"
"“Blow yer trenches! You always want trenches; you ought to ha’ been"
"born a rabbit Snippy.”"
"“Ain’t they got any necks, then?” said a third, abruptly—a little,"
"contemplative, dark man, smoking a pipe."
"I repeated my description."
"“Octopuses,” said he, “that’s what I calls ’em. Talk about fishers of"
"men—fighters of fish it is this time!”"
"“It ain’t no murder killing beasts like that,” said the first speaker."
"“Why not shell the darned things strite off and finish ’em?” said the"
"little dark man. “You carn tell what they might do.”"
"“Where’s your shells?” said the first speaker. “There ain’t no time. Do"
"it in a rush, that’s my tip, and do it at once.”"
"So they discussed it. After a while I left them, and went on to the"
"railway station to get as many morning papers as I could."
"But I will not weary the reader with a description of that long morning"
"and of the longer afternoon. I did not succeed in getting a glimpse of"
"the common, for even Horsell and Chobham church towers were in the"
"hands of the military authorities. The soldiers I addressed didn’t know"
"anything; the officers were mysterious as well as busy. I found people"
"in the town quite secure again in the presence of the military, and I"
"heard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son"
"was among the dead on the common. The soldiers had made the people on"
"the outskirts of Horsell lock up and leave their houses."
"I got back to lunch about two, very tired for, as I have said, the day"
"was extremely hot and dull; and in order to refresh myself I took a"
"cold bath in the afternoon. About half past four I went up to the"
"railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had"
"contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,"
"Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didn’t know."
"The Martians did not show an inch of themselves. They seemed busy in"
"their pit, and there was a sound of hammering and an almost continuous"
"streamer of smoke. Apparently they were busy getting ready for a"
"struggle. “Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without"
"success,” was the stereotyped formula of the papers. A sapper told me"
"it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The"
"Martians took as much notice of such advances as we should of the"
"lowing of a cow."
"I must confess the sight of all this armament, all this preparation,"
"greatly excited me. My imagination became belligerent, and defeated the"
"invaders in a dozen striking ways; something of my schoolboy dreams of"
"battle and heroism came back. It hardly seemed a fair fight to me at"
"that time. They seemed very helpless in that pit of theirs."
"About three o’clock there began the thud of a gun at measured intervals"
"from Chertsey or Addlestone. I learned that the smouldering pine wood"
"into which the second cylinder had fallen was being shelled, in the"
"hope of destroying that object before it opened. It was only about"
"five, however, that a field gun reached Chobham for use against the"
"first body of Martians."
"About six in the evening, as I sat at tea with my wife in the"
"summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon"
"us, I heard a muffled detonation from the common, and immediately after"
"a gust of firing. Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling"
"crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon"
"the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst"
"into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it"
"slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the"
"roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been"
"at work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it,"
"flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap"
"of broken red fragments upon the flower bed by my study window."
"I and my wife stood amazed. Then I realised that the crest of Maybury"
"Hill must be within range of the Martians’ Heat-Ray now that the"
"college was cleared out of the way."
"At that I gripped my wife’s arm, and without ceremony ran her out into"
"the road. Then I fetched out the servant, telling her I would go"
"upstairs myself for the box she was clamouring for."
"“We can’t possibly stay here,” I said; and as I spoke the firing"
"reopened for a moment upon the common."
"“But where are we to go?” said my wife in terror."
"I thought perplexed. Then I remembered her cousins at Leatherhead."
"“Leatherhead!” I shouted above the sudden noise."
"She looked away from me downhill. The people were coming out of their"
"houses, astonished."
"“How are we to get to Leatherhead?” she said."
"Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge;"
"three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two"
"others dismounted, and began running from house to house. The sun,"
"shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees,"
"seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything."
"“Stop here,” said I; “you are safe here”; and I started off at once for"
"the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart. I"
"ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the"
"hill would be moving. I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what was"
"going on behind his house. A man stood with his back to me, talking to"
"him."
"“I must have a pound,” said the landlord, “and I’ve no one to drive"
"it.”"
"“I’ll give you two,” said I, over the stranger’s shoulder."
"“What for?”"
"“And I’ll bring it back by midnight,” I said."
"“Lord!” said the landlord; “what’s the hurry? I’m selling my bit of a"
"pig. Two pounds, and you bring it back? What’s going on now?”"
"I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog"
"cart. At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the"
"landlord should leave his. I took care to have the cart there and then,"
"drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and"
"servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such plate as"
"we had, and so forth. The beech trees below the house were burning"
"while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red. While I was"
"occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came running up. He"
"was going from house to house, warning people to leave. He was going on"
"as I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in a"
"tablecloth. I shouted after him:"
"“What news?”"
"He turned, stared, bawled something about “crawling out in a thing like"
"a dish cover,” and ran on to the gate of the house at the crest. A"
"sudden whirl of black smoke driving across the road hid him for a"
"moment. I ran to my neighbour’s door and rapped to satisfy myself of"
"what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had"
"locked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get"
"my servant’s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of"
"the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver’s"
"seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and"
"noise, and spanking down the opposite slope of Maybury Hill towards Old"
"Woking."
"In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either"
"side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the"
"doctor’s cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head"
"to look at the hillside I was leaving. Thick streamers of black smoke"
"shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and"
"throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward. The smoke"
"already extended far away to the east and west—to the Byfleet pine"
"woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted with"
"people running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct"
"through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that"
"was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles."
"Apparently the Martians were setting fire to everything within range of"
"their Heat-Ray."
"I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention"
"to the horse. When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the"
"black smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose"
"rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult. I"
"overtook and passed the doctor between Woking and Send."
"X."
"IN THE STORM."
"Leatherhead is about twelve miles from Maybury Hill. The scent of hay"
"was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges"
"on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The"
"heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury"
"Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful"
"and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine"
"o’clock, and the horse had an hour’s rest while I took supper with my"
"cousins and commended my wife to their care."
"My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed"
"with forebodings of evil. I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out"
"that the Martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness, and at the"
"utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in"
"monosyllables. Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she"
"would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. Would"
"that I had! Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted."
"For my own part, I had been feverishly excited all day. Something very"
"like the war fever that occasionally runs through a civilised community"
"had got into my blood, and in my heart I was not so very sorry that I"
"had to return to Maybury that night. I was even afraid that that last"
"fusillade I had heard might mean the extermination of our invaders from"
"Mars. I can best express my state of mind by saying that I wanted to be"
"in at the death."
"It was nearly eleven when I started to return. The night was"
"unexpectedly dark; to me, walking out of the lighted passage of my"
"cousins’ house, it seemed indeed black, and it was as hot and close as"
"the day. Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath"
"stirred the shrubs about us. My cousins’ man lit both lamps. Happily, I"
"knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the doorway,"
"and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly she"
"turned and went in, leaving my cousins side by side wishing me good"
"hap."
"I was a little depressed at first with the contagion of my wife’s"
"fears, but very soon my thoughts reverted to the Martians. At that time"
"I was absolutely in the dark as to the course of the evening’s"
"fighting. I did not know even the circumstances that had precipitated"
"the conflict. As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I"
"returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western"
"horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the"
"sky. The driving clouds of the gathering thunderstorm mingled there"
"with masses of black and red smoke."
"Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so the"
"village showed not a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident"
"at the corner of the road to Pyrford, where a knot of people stood with"
"their backs to me. They said nothing to me as I passed. I do not know"
"what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor do I know"
"if the silent houses I passed on my way were sleeping securely, or"
"deserted and empty, or harassed and watching against the terror of the"
"night."
"From Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the"
"Wey, and the red glare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little"
"hill beyond Pyrford Church the glare came into view again, and the"
"trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was"
"upon me. Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind"
"me, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill, with its tree-tops"
"and roofs black and sharp against the red."
"Even as I beheld this a lurid green glare lit the road about me and"
"showed the distant woods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug at the reins."
"I saw that the driving clouds had been pierced as it were by a thread"
"of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling into the"
"field to my left. It was the third falling star!"
"Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out"
"the first lightning of the gathering storm, and the thunder burst like"
"a rocket overhead. The horse took the bit between his teeth and bolted."
"A moderate incline runs towards the foot of Maybury Hill, and down this"
"we clattered. Once the lightning had begun, it went on in as rapid a"
"succession of flashes as I have ever seen. The thunderclaps, treading"
"one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment,"
"sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the"
"usual detonating reverberations. The flickering light was blinding and"
"confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the"
"slope."
"At first I regarded little but the road before me, and then abruptly my"
"attention was arrested by something that was moving rapidly down the"
"opposite slope of Maybury Hill. At first I took it for the wet roof of"
"a house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift"
"rolling movement. It was an elusive vision—a moment of bewildering"
"darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the"
"Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees,"
"and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright."
"And this Thing I saw! How can I describe it? A monstrous tripod, higher"
"than many houses, striding over the young pine trees, and smashing them"
"aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now"
"across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the"
"clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder."
"A flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in"
"the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the"
"next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool"
"tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression"
"those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a"
"great body of machinery on a tripod stand."
"Then suddenly the trees in the pine wood ahead of me were parted, as"
"brittle reeds are parted by a man thrusting through them; they were"
"snapped off and driven headlong, and a second huge tripod appeared,"
"rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me. And I was galloping hard to"
"meet it! At the sight of the second monster my nerve went altogether."
"Not stopping to look again, I wrenched the horse’s head hard round to"
"the right and in another moment the dog cart had heeled over upon the"
"horse; the shafts smashed noisily, and I was flung sideways and fell"
"heavily into a shallow pool of water."
"I crawled out almost immediately, and crouched, my feet still in the"
"water, under a clump of furze. The horse lay motionless (his neck was"
"broken, poor brute!) and by the lightning flashes I saw the black bulk"
"of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still"
"spinning slowly. In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding"
"by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford."
"Seen nearer, the Thing was incredibly strange, for it was no mere"
"insensate machine driving on its way. Machine it was, with a ringing"
"metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which"
"gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange"
"body. It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood"
"that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a"
"head looking about. Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal"
"like a gigantic fisherman’s basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted"
"out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in an"
"instant it was gone."
"So much I saw then, all vaguely for the flickering of the lightning, in"
"blinding highlights and dense black shadows."
"As it passed it set up an exultant deafening howl that drowned the"
"thunder—“Aloo! Aloo!”—and in another minute it was with its companion,"
"half a mile away, stooping over something in the field. I have no doubt"
"this Thing in the field was the third of the ten cylinders they had"
"fired at us from Mars."
"For some minutes I lay there in the rain and darkness watching, by the"
"intermittent light, these monstrous beings of metal moving about in the"
"distance over the hedge tops. A thin hail was now beginning, and as it"
"came and went their figures grew misty and then flashed into clearness"
"again. Now and then came a gap in the lightning, and the night"
"swallowed them up."
"I was soaked with hail above and puddle water below. It was some time"
"before my blank astonishment would let me struggle up the bank to a"
"drier position, or think at all of my imminent peril."
"Not far from me was a little one-roomed squatter’s hut of wood,"
"surrounded by a patch of potato garden. I struggled to my feet at last,"
"and, crouching and making use of every chance of cover, I made a run"
"for this. I hammered at the door, but I could not make the people hear"
"(if there were any people inside), and after a time I desisted, and,"
"availing myself of a ditch for the greater part of the way, succeeded"
"in crawling, unobserved by these monstrous machines, into the pine"
"woods towards Maybury."
"Under cover of this I pushed on, wet and shivering now, towards my own"
"house. I walked among the trees trying to find the footpath. It was"
"very dark indeed in the wood, for the lightning was now becoming"
"infrequent, and the hail, which was pouring down in a torrent, fell in"
"columns through the gaps in the heavy foliage."
"If I had fully realised the meaning of all the things I had seen I"
"should have immediately worked my way round through Byfleet to Street"
"Cobham, and so gone back to rejoin my wife at Leatherhead. But that"
"night the strangeness of things about me, and my physical wretchedness,"
"prevented me, for I was bruised, weary, wet to the skin, deafened and"
"blinded by the storm."
"I had a vague idea of going on to my own house, and that was as much"
"motive as I had. I staggered through the trees, fell into a ditch and"
"bruised my knees against a plank, and finally splashed out into the"
"lane that ran down from the College Arms. I say splashed, for the storm"
"water was sweeping the sand down the hill in a muddy torrent. There in"
"the darkness a man blundered into me and sent me reeling back."
"He gave a cry of terror, sprang sideways, and rushed on before I could"
"gather my wits sufficiently to speak to him. So heavy was the stress of"
"the storm just at this place that I had the hardest task to win my way"
"up the hill. I went close up to the fence on the left and worked my way"
"along its palings."
"Near the top I stumbled upon something soft, and, by a flash of"
"lightning, saw between my feet a heap of black broadcloth and a pair of"
"boots. Before I could distinguish clearly how the man lay, the flicker"
"of light had passed. I stood over him waiting for the next flash. When"
"it came, I saw that he was a sturdy man, cheaply but not shabbily"
"dressed; his head was bent under his body, and he lay crumpled up close"
"to the fence, as though he had been flung violently against it."
"Overcoming the repugnance natural to one who had never before touched a"
"dead body, I stooped and turned him over to feel for his heart. He was"
"quite dead. Apparently his neck had been broken. The lightning flashed"
"for a third time, and his face leaped upon me. I sprang to my feet. It"
"was the landlord of the Spotted Dog, whose conveyance I had taken."
"I stepped over him gingerly and pushed on up the hill. I made my way by"
"the police station and the College Arms towards my own house. Nothing"
"was burning on the hillside, though from the common there still came a"
"red glare and a rolling tumult of ruddy smoke beating up against the"
"drenching hail. So far as I could see by the flashes, the houses about"
"me were mostly uninjured. By the College Arms a dark heap lay in the"
"road."
"Down the road towards Maybury Bridge there were voices and the sound of"
"feet, but I had not the courage to shout or to go to them. I let myself"
"in with my latchkey, closed, locked and bolted the door, staggered to"
"the foot of the staircase, and sat down. My imagination was full of"
"those striding metallic monsters, and of the dead body smashed against"
"the fence."
"I crouched at the foot of the staircase with my back to the wall,"
"shivering violently."
"XI."
"AT THE WINDOW."
"I have already said that my storms of emotion have a trick of"
"exhausting themselves. After a time I discovered that I was cold and"
"wet, and with little pools of water about me on the stair carpet. I got"
"up almost mechanically, went into the dining room and drank some"
"whisky, and then I was moved to change my clothes."
"After I had done that I went upstairs to my study, but why I did so I"
"do not know. The window of my study looks over the trees and the"
"railway towards Horsell Common. In the hurry of our departure this"
"window had been left open. The passage was dark, and, by contrast with"
"the picture the window frame enclosed, the side of the room seemed"
"impenetrably dark. I stopped short in the doorway."
"The thunderstorm had passed. The towers of the Oriental College and the"
"pine trees about it had gone, and very far away, lit by a vivid red"
"glare, the common about the sand-pits was visible. Across the light"
"huge black shapes, grotesque and strange, moved busily to and fro."
"It seemed indeed as if the whole country in that direction was on"
"fire—a broad hillside set with minute tongues of flame, swaying and"
"writhing with the gusts of the dying storm, and throwing a red"
"reflection upon the cloud scud above. Every now and then a haze of"
"smoke from some nearer conflagration drove across the window and hid"
"the Martian shapes. I could not see what they were doing, nor the clear"
"form of them, nor recognise the black objects they were busied upon."
"Neither could I see the nearer fire, though the reflections of it"
"danced on the wall and ceiling of the study. A sharp, resinous tang of"
"burning was in the air."
"I closed the door noiselessly and crept towards the window. As I did"
"so, the view opened out until, on the one hand, it reached to the"
"houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and"
"blackened pine woods of Byfleet. There was a light down below the hill,"
"on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along the"
"Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins. The"
"light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and"
"a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs. Then I"
"perceived this was a wrecked train, the fore part smashed and on fire,"
"the hinder carriages still upon the rails."
"Between these three main centres of light—the houses, the train, and"
"the burning county towards Chobham—stretched irregular patches of dark"
"country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and"
"smoking ground. It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set"
"with fire. It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries at"
"night. At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I peered"
"intently for them. Later I saw against the light of Woking station a"
"number of black figures hurrying one after the other across the line."
"And this was the little world in which I had been living securely for"
"years, this fiery chaos! What had happened in the last seven hours I"
"still did not know; nor did I know, though I was beginning to guess,"
"the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I"
"had seen disgorged from the cylinder. With a queer feeling of"
"impersonal interest I turned my desk chair to the window, sat down, and"
"stared at the blackened country, and particularly at the three gigantic"
"black things that were going to and fro in the glare about the"
"sand-pits."
"They seemed amazingly busy. I began to ask myself what they could be."
"Were they intelligent mechanisms? Such a thing I felt was impossible."
"Or did a Martian sit within each, ruling, directing, using, much as a"
"man’s brain sits and rules in his body? I began to compare the things"
"to human machines, to ask myself for the first time in my life how an"
"ironclad or a steam engine would seem to an intelligent lower animal."
"The storm had left the sky clear, and over the smoke of the burning"
"land the little fading pinpoint of Mars was dropping into the west,"
"when a soldier came into my garden. I heard a slight scraping at the"
"fence, and rousing myself from the lethargy that had fallen upon me, I"
"looked down and saw him dimly, clambering over the palings. At the"
"sight of another human being my torpor passed, and I leaned out of the"
"window eagerly."
"“Hist!” said I, in a whisper."
"He stopped astride of the fence in doubt. Then he came over and across"
"the lawn to the corner of the house. He bent down and stepped softly."
"“Who’s there?” he said, also whispering, standing under the window and"
"peering up."
"“Where are you going?” I asked."
"“God knows.”"
"“Are you trying to hide?”"
"“That’s it.”"
"“Come into the house,” I said."
"I went down, unfastened the door, and let him in, and locked the door"
"again. I could not see his face. He was hatless, and his coat was"
"unbuttoned."
"“My God!” he said, as I drew him in."
"“What has happened?” I asked."
"“What hasn’t?” In the obscurity I could see he made a gesture of"
"despair. “They wiped us out—simply wiped us out,” he repeated again and"
"again."
"He followed me, almost mechanically, into the dining room."
"“Take some whisky,” I said, pouring out a stiff dose."
"He drank it. Then abruptly he sat down before the table, put his head"
"on his arms, and began to sob and weep like a little boy, in a perfect"
"passion of emotion, while I, with a curious forgetfulness of my own"
"recent despair, stood beside him, wondering."
"It was a long time before he could steady his nerves to answer my"
"questions, and then he answered perplexingly and brokenly. He was a"
"driver in the artillery, and had only come into action about seven. At"
"that time firing was going on across the common, and it was said the"
"first party of Martians were crawling slowly towards their second"
"cylinder under cover of a metal shield."
"Later this shield staggered up on tripod legs and became the first of"
"the fighting-machines I had seen. The gun he drove had been unlimbered"
"near Horsell, in order to command the sand-pits, and its arrival it was"
"that had precipitated the action. As the limber gunners went to the"
"rear, his horse trod in a rabbit hole and came down, throwing him into"
"a depression of the ground. At the same moment the gun exploded behind"
"him, the ammunition blew up, there was fire all about him, and he found"
"himself lying under a heap of charred dead men and dead horses."
"“I lay still,” he said, “scared out of my wits, with the fore quarter"
"of a horse atop of me. We’d been wiped out. And the smell—good God!"
"Like burnt meat! I was hurt across the back by the fall of the horse,"
"and there I had to lie until I felt better. Just like parade it had"
"been a minute before—then stumble, bang, swish!”"
"“Wiped out!” he said."
"He had hid under the dead horse for a long time, peeping out furtively"
"across the common. The Cardigan men had tried a rush, in skirmishing"
"order, at the pit, simply to be swept out of existence. Then the"
"monster had risen to its feet and had begun to walk leisurely to and"
"fro across the common among the few fugitives, with its headlike hood"
"turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being. A kind of"
"arm carried a complicated metallic case, about which green flashes"
"scintillated, and out of the funnel of this there smoked the Heat-Ray."
"In a few minutes there was, so far as the soldier could see, not a"
"living thing left upon the common, and every bush and tree upon it that"
"was not already a blackened skeleton was burning. The hussars had been"
"on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of"
"them. He heard the Maxims rattle for a time and then become still. The"
"giant saved Woking station and its cluster of houses until the last;"
"then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and the town became"
"a heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut off the Heat-Ray, and"
"turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle away towards"
"the smouldering pine woods that sheltered the second cylinder. As it"
"did so a second glittering Titan built itself up out of the pit."
"The second monster followed the first, and at that the artilleryman"
"began to crawl very cautiously across the hot heather ash towards"
"Horsell. He managed to get alive into the ditch by the side of the"
"road, and so escaped to Woking. There his story became ejaculatory. The"
"place was impassable. It seems there were a few people alive there,"
"frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded. He was turned"
"aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken"
"wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He saw this one pursue a"
"man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock his head"
"against the trunk of a pine tree. At last, after nightfall, the"
"artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment."
"Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope of"
"getting out of danger Londonward. People were hiding in trenches and"
"cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village"
"and Send. He had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the"
"water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out"
"like a spring upon the road."
"That was the story I got from him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling"
"me and trying to make me see the things he had seen. He had eaten no"
"food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I found some"
"mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room. We lit no"
"lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our hands"
"would touch upon bread or meat. As he talked, things about us came"
"darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled bushes and broken rose"
"trees outside the window grew distinct. It would seem that a number of"
"men or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to see his face,"
"blackened and haggard, as no doubt mine was also."
"When we had finished eating we went softly upstairs to my study, and I"
"looked again out of the open window. In one night the valley had become"
"a valley of ashes. The fires had dwindled now. Where flames had been"
"there were now streamers of smoke; but the countless ruins of shattered"
"and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had"
"hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn."
"Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape—a white"
"railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh"
"amid the wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare had"
"destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal. And shining with"
"the growing light of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about"
"the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the"
"desolation they had made."
"It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again"
"puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the"
"brightening dawn—streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished."
"Beyond were the pillars of fire about Chobham. They became pillars of"
"bloodshot smoke at the first touch of day."
"XII."
"WHAT I SAW OF THE DESTRUCTION OF WEYBRIDGE AND SHEPPERTON."
"As the dawn grew brighter we withdrew from the window from which we had"
"watched the Martians, and went very quietly downstairs."
"The artilleryman agreed with me that the house was no place to stay in."
"He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his"
"battery—No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once"
"to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians"
"impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and go"
"with her out of the country forthwith. For I already perceived clearly"
"that the country about London must inevitably be the scene of a"
"disastrous struggle before such creatures as these could be destroyed."
"Between us and Leatherhead, however, lay the third cylinder, with its"
"guarding giants. Had I been alone, I think I should have taken my"
"chance and struck across country. But the artilleryman dissuaded me:"
"“It’s no kindness to the right sort of wife,” he said, “to make her a"
"widow”; and in the end I agreed to go with him, under cover of the"
"woods, northward as far as Street Cobham before I parted with him."
"Thence I would make a big detour by Epsom to reach Leatherhead."
"I should have started at once, but my companion had been in active"
"service and he knew better than that. He made me ransack the house for"
"a flask, which he filled with whisky; and we lined every available"
"pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out"
"of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by"
"which I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted. In the road lay"
"a group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the"
"Heat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped—a"
"clock, a slipper, a silver spoon, and the like poor valuables. At the"
"corner turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with"
"boxes and furniture, and horseless, heeled over on a broken wheel. A"
"cash box had been hastily smashed open and thrown under the debris."
"Except the lodge at the Orphanage, which was still on fire, none of the"
"houses had suffered very greatly here. The Heat-Ray had shaved the"
"chimney tops and passed. Yet, save ourselves, there did not seem to be"
"a living soul on Maybury Hill. The majority of the inhabitants had"
"escaped, I suppose, by way of the Old Woking road—the road I had taken"
"when I drove to Leatherhead—or they had hidden."
"We went down the lane, by the body of the man in black, sodden now from"
"the overnight hail, and broke into the woods at the foot of the hill."
"We pushed through these towards the railway without meeting a soul. The"
"woods across the line were but the scarred and blackened ruins of"
"woods; for the most part the trees had fallen, but a certain proportion"
"still stood, dismal grey stems, with dark brown foliage instead of"
"green."
"On our side the fire had done no more than scorch the nearer trees; it"
"had failed to secure its footing. In one place the woodmen had been at"
"work on Saturday; trees, felled and freshly trimmed, lay in a clearing,"
"with heaps of sawdust by the sawing-machine and its engine. Hard by was"
"a temporary hut, deserted. There was not a breath of wind this morning,"
"and everything was strangely still. Even the birds were hushed, and as"
"we hurried along I and the artilleryman talked in whispers and looked"
"now and again over our shoulders. Once or twice we stopped to listen."
"After a time we drew near the road, and as we did so we heard the"
"clatter of hoofs and saw through the tree stems three cavalry soldiers"
"riding slowly towards Woking. We hailed them, and they halted while we"
"hurried towards them. It was a lieutenant and a couple of privates of"
"the 8th Hussars, with a stand like a theodolite, which the artilleryman"
"told me was a heliograph."
"“You are the first men I’ve seen coming this way this morning,” said"
"the lieutenant. “What’s brewing?”"
"His voice and face were eager. The men behind him stared curiously. The"
"artilleryman jumped down the bank into the road and saluted."
"“Gun destroyed last night, sir. Have been hiding. Trying to rejoin"
"battery, sir. You’ll come in sight of the Martians, I expect, about"
"half a mile along this road.”"
"“What the dickens are they like?” asked the lieutenant."
"“Giants in armour, sir. Hundred feet high. Three legs and a body like"
"’luminium, with a mighty great head in a hood, sir.”"
"“Get out!” said the lieutenant. “What confounded nonsense!”"
"“You’ll see, sir. They carry a kind of box, sir, that shoots fire and"
"strikes you dead.”"
"“What d’ye mean—a gun?”"
"“No, sir,” and the artilleryman began a vivid account of the Heat-Ray."
"Halfway through, the lieutenant interrupted him and looked up at me. I"
"was still standing on the bank by the side of the road."
"“It’s perfectly true,” I said."
"“Well,” said the lieutenant, “I suppose it’s my business to see it too."
"Look here”—to the artilleryman—“we’re detailed here clearing people out"
"of their houses. You’d better go along and report yourself to"
"Brigadier-General Marvin, and tell him all you know. He’s at Weybridge."
"Know the way?”"
"“I do,” I said; and he turned his horse southward again."
"“Half a mile, you say?” said he."
"“At most,” I answered, and pointed over the treetops southward. He"
"thanked me and rode on, and we saw them no more."
"Farther along we came upon a group of three women and two children in"
"the road, busy clearing out a labourer’s cottage. They had got hold of"
"a little hand truck, and were piling it up with unclean-looking bundles"
"and shabby furniture. They were all too assiduously engaged to talk to"
"us as we passed."
"By Byfleet station we emerged from the pine trees, and found the"
"country calm and peaceful under the morning sunlight. We were far"
"beyond the range of the Heat-Ray there, and had it not been for the"
"silent desertion of some of the houses, the stirring movement of"
"packing in others, and the knot of soldiers standing on the bridge over"
"the railway and staring down the line towards Woking, the day would"
"have seemed very like any other Sunday."
"Several farm waggons and carts were moving creakily along the road to"
"Addlestone, and suddenly through the gate of a field we saw, across a"
"stretch of flat meadow, six twelve-pounders standing neatly at equal"
"distances pointing towards Woking. The gunners stood by the guns"
"waiting, and the ammunition waggons were at a business-like distance."
"The men stood almost as if under inspection."
"“That’s good!” said I. “They will get one fair shot, at any rate.”"
"The artilleryman hesitated at the gate."
"“I shall go on,” he said."
"Farther on towards Weybridge, just over the bridge, there were a number"
"of men in white fatigue jackets throwing up a long rampart, and more"
"guns behind."
"“It’s bows and arrows against the lightning, anyhow,” said the"
"artilleryman. “They ’aven’t seen that fire-beam yet.”"
"The officers who were not actively engaged stood and stared over the"
"treetops southwestward, and the men digging would stop every now and"
"again to stare in the same direction."
"Byfleet was in a tumult; people packing, and a score of hussars, some"
"of them dismounted, some on horseback, were hunting them about. Three"
"or four black government waggons, with crosses in white circles, and an"
"old omnibus, among other vehicles, were being loaded in the village"
"street. There were scores of people, most of them sufficiently"
"sabbatical to have assumed their best clothes. The soldiers were having"
"the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their"
"position. We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score"
"or more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating with"
"the corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his"
"arm."
"“Do you know what’s over there?” I said, pointing at the pine tops that"
"hid the Martians."
"“Eh?” said he, turning. “I was explainin’ these is vallyble.”"
"“Death!” I shouted. “Death is coming! Death!” and leaving him to digest"
"that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man. At the corner I"
"looked back. The soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his"
"box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely"
"over the trees."
"No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were"
"established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen"
"in any town before. Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing"
"miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants"
"of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed,"
"were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping, children"
"excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing"
"variation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of it all the"
"worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration, and his"
"bell was jangling out above the excitement."
"I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain,"
"made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of"
"soldiers—here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white—were warning"
"people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the"
"firing began. We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing"
"crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the"
"swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary"
"traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage"
"of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage"
"struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at"
"a later hour."
"We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found"
"ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames"
"join. Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little"
"cart. The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be"
"hired, and there was a ferry across the river. On the Shepperton side"
"was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of Shepperton"
"Church—it has been replaced by a spire—rose above the trees."
"Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives. As yet the"
"flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more people"
"than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross. People came"
"panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even"
"carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of their"
"household goods piled thereon. One man told us he meant to try to get"
"away from Shepperton station."
"There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. The idea"
"people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable"
"human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly"
"destroyed in the end. Every now and then people would glance nervously"
"across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over"
"there was still."
"Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was"
"quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed"
"there from the boats went tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat"
"had just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of"
"the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to"
"help. The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours."
"“What’s that?” cried a boatman, and “Shut up, you fool!” said a man"
"near me to a yelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the"
"direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud—the sound of a gun."
"The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across"
"the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the"
"chorus, firing heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone"
"stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible"
"to us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding"
"unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless"
"in the warm sunlight."
"“The sojers’ll stop ’em,” said a woman beside me, doubtfully. A"
"haziness rose over the treetops."
"Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of"
"smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground"
"heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or"
"three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished."
"“Here they are!” shouted a man in a blue jersey. “Yonder! D’yer see"
"them? Yonder!”"
"Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured"
"Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat"
"meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards"
"the river. Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going with a"
"rolling motion and as fast as flying birds."
"Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth. Their armoured"
"bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the"
"guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the extreme"
"left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air, and"
"the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote"
"towards Chertsey, and struck the town."
"At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near"
"the water’s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There"
"was no screaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse murmur and a"
"movement of feet—a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened to"
"drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent"
"me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden. A woman thrust"
"at me with her hand and rushed past me. I turned with the rush of the"
"people, but I was not too terrified for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray"
"was in my mind. To get under water! That was it!"
"“Get under water!” I shouted, unheeded."
"I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed"
"right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water. Others did"
"the same. A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I"
"rushed past. The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the"
"river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep."
"Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred"
"yards away, I flung myself forward under the surface. The splashes of"
"the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like"
"thunderclaps in my ears. People were landing hastily on both sides of"
"the river. But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment"
"of the people running this way and that than a man would of the"
"confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked. When,"
"half suffocated, I raised my head above water, the Martian’s hood"
"pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river, and"
"as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the"
"Heat-Ray."
"In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading halfway"
"across. The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in"
"another moment it had raised itself to its full height again, close to"
"the village of Shepperton. Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to"
"anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that"
"village, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concussion, the last"
"close upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster was already"
"raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst six"
"yards above the hood."
"I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of the other"
"four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer"
"incident. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the"
"body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to"
"dodge, the fourth shell."
"The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing. The hood bulged,"
"flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and"
"glittering metal."
"“Hit!” shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer."
"I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me. I could"
"have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation."
"The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not"
"fall over. It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer"
"heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now"
"rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton. The living"
"intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to"
"the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate"
"device of metal whirling to destruction. It drove along in a straight"
"line, incapable of guidance. It struck the tower of Shepperton Church,"
"smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done,"
"swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into"
"the river out of my sight."
"A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam, mud,"
"and shattered metal shot far up into the sky. As the camera of the"
"Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into steam."
"In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost"
"scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people"
"struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly"
"above the seething and roar of the Martian’s collapse."
"For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need of"
"self-preservation. I splashed through the tumultuous water, pushing"
"aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the bend. Half a"
"dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves."
"The fallen Martian came into sight downstream, lying across the river,"
"and for the most part submerged."
"Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through the"
"tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and vaguely,"
"the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray"
"of mud and froth into the air. The tentacles swayed and struck like"
"living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of these"
"movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life"
"amid the waves. Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were"
"spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine."
"My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling,"
"like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns. A"
"man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me and"
"pointed. Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic"
"strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey. The"
"Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly."
"At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until"
"movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as"
"long as I could. The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly"
"growing hotter."
"When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair"
"and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog"
"that at first hid the Martians altogether. The noise was deafening."
"Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist."
"They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing,"
"tumultuous ruins of their comrade."
"The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two"
"hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham. The generators of the"
"Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way and"
"that."
"The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of"
"noises—the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses,"
"the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling"
"and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with"
"the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over"
"Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that"
"gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses"
"still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in"
"the steam, with the fire behind them going to and fro."
"For a moment perhaps I stood there, breast-high in the almost boiling"
"water, dumbfounded at my position, hopeless of escape. Through the reek"
"I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out"
"of the water through the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through"
"grass from the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dismay"
"on the towing path."
"Then suddenly the white flashes of the Heat-Ray came leaping towards"
"me. The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out"
"flames; the trees changed to fire with a roar. The Ray flickered up and"
"down the towing path, licking off the people who ran this way and that,"
"and came down to the water’s edge not fifty yards from where I stood."
"It swept across the river to Shepperton, and the water in its track"
"rose in a boiling weal crested with steam. I turned shoreward."
"In another moment the huge wave, well-nigh at the boiling-point had"
"rushed upon me. I screamed aloud, and scalded, half blinded, agonised,"
"I staggered through the leaping, hissing water towards the shore. Had"
"my foot stumbled, it would have been the end. I fell helplessly, in"
"full sight of the Martians, upon the broad, bare gravelly spit that"
"runs down to mark the angle of the Wey and Thames. I expected nothing"
"but death."
"I have a dim memory of the foot of a Martian coming down within a score"
"of yards of my head, driving straight into the loose gravel, whirling"
"it this way and that and lifting again; of a long suspense, and then of"
"the four carrying the debris of their comrade between them, now clear"
"and then presently faint through a veil of smoke, receding"
"interminably, as it seemed to me, across a vast space of river and"
"meadow. And then, very slowly, I realised that by a miracle I had"
"escaped."
"XIII."
"HOW I FELL IN WITH THE CURATE."
"After getting this sudden lesson in the power of terrestrial weapons,"
"the Martians retreated to their original position upon Horsell Common;"
"and in their haste, and encumbered with the debris of their smashed"
"companion, they no doubt overlooked many such a stray and negligible"
"victim as myself. Had they left their comrade and pushed on forthwith,"
"there was nothing at that time between them and London but batteries of"
"twelve-pounder guns, and they would certainly have reached the capital"
"in advance of the tidings of their approach; as sudden, dreadful, and"
"destructive their advent would have been as the earthquake that"
"destroyed Lisbon a century ago."
"But they were in no hurry. Cylinder followed cylinder on its"
"interplanetary flight; every twenty-four hours brought them"
"reinforcement. And meanwhile the military and naval authorities, now"
"fully alive to the tremendous power of their antagonists, worked with"
"furious energy. Every minute a fresh gun came into position until,"
"before twilight, every copse, every row of suburban villas on the hilly"
"slopes about Kingston and Richmond, masked an expectant black muzzle."
"And through the charred and desolated area—perhaps twenty square miles"
"altogether—that encircled the Martian encampment on Horsell Common,"
"through charred and ruined villages among the green trees, through the"
"blackened and smoking arcades that had been but a day ago pine"
"spinneys, crawled the devoted scouts with the heliographs that were"
"presently to warn the gunners of the Martian approach. But the Martians"
"now understood our command of artillery and the danger of human"
"proximity, and not a man ventured within a mile of either cylinder,"
"save at the price of his life."
"It would seem that these giants spent the earlier part of the afternoon"
"in going to and fro, transferring everything from the second and third"
"cylinders—the second in Addlestone Golf Links and the third at"
"Pyrford—to their original pit on Horsell Common. Over that, above the"
"blackened heather and ruined buildings that stretched far and wide,"
"stood one as sentinel, while the rest abandoned their vast"
"fighting-machines and descended into the pit. They were hard at work"
"there far into the night, and the towering pillar of dense green smoke"
"that rose therefrom could be seen from the hills about Merrow, and"
"even, it is said, from Banstead and Epsom Downs."
"And while the Martians behind me were thus preparing for their next"
"sally, and in front of me Humanity gathered for the battle, I made my"
"way with infinite pains and labour from the fire and smoke of burning"
"Weybridge towards London."
"I saw an abandoned boat, very small and remote, drifting down-stream;"
"and throwing off the most of my sodden clothes, I went after it, gained"
"it, and so escaped out of that destruction. There were no oars in the"
"boat, but I contrived to paddle, as well as my parboiled hands would"
"allow, down the river towards Halliford and Walton, going very"
"tediously and continually looking behind me, as you may well"
"understand. I followed the river, because I considered that the water"
"gave me my best chance of escape should these giants return."
"The hot water from the Martian’s overthrow drifted downstream with me,"
"so that for the best part of a mile I could see little of either bank."
"Once, however, I made out a string of black figures hurrying across the"
"meadows from the direction of Weybridge. Halliford, it seemed, was"
"deserted, and several of the houses facing the river were on fire. It"
"was strange to see the place quite tranquil, quite desolate under the"
"hot blue sky, with the smoke and little threads of flame going straight"
"up into the heat of the afternoon. Never before had I seen houses"
"burning without the accompaniment of an obstructive crowd. A little"
"farther on the dry reeds up the bank were smoking and glowing, and a"
"line of fire inland was marching steadily across a late field of hay."
"For a long time I drifted, so painful and weary was I after the"
"violence I had been through, and so intense the heat upon the water."
"Then my fears got the better of me again, and I resumed my paddling."
"The sun scorched my bare back. At last, as the bridge at Walton was"
"coming into sight round the bend, my fever and faintness overcame my"
"fears, and I landed on the Middlesex bank and lay down, deadly sick,"
"amid the long grass. I suppose the time was then about four or five"
"o’clock. I got up presently, walked perhaps half a mile without meeting"
"a soul, and then lay down again in the shadow of a hedge. I seem to"
"remember talking, wanderingly, to myself during that last spurt. I was"
"also very thirsty, and bitterly regretful I had drunk no more water. It"
"is a curious thing that I felt angry with my wife; I cannot account for"
"it, but my impotent desire to reach Leatherhead worried me excessively."
"I do not clearly remember the arrival of the curate, so that probably I"
"dozed. I became aware of him as a seated figure in soot-smudged shirt"
"sleeves, and with his upturned, clean-shaven face staring at a faint"
"flickering that danced over the sky. The sky was what is called a"
"mackerel sky—rows and rows of faint down-plumes of cloud, just tinted"
"with the midsummer sunset."
"I sat up, and at the rustle of my motion he looked at me quickly."
"“Have you any water?” I asked abruptly."
"He shook his head."
"“You have been asking for water for the last hour,” he said."
"For a moment we were silent, taking stock of each other. I dare say he"
"found me a strange enough figure, naked, save for my water-soaked"
"trousers and socks, scalded, and my face and shoulders blackened by the"
"smoke. His face was a fair weakness, his chin retreated, and his hair"
"lay in crisp, almost flaxen curls on his low forehead; his eyes were"
"rather large, pale blue, and blankly staring. He spoke abruptly,"
"looking vacantly away from me."
"“What does it mean?” he said. “What do these things mean?”"
"I stared at him and made no answer."
"He extended a thin white hand and spoke in almost a complaining tone."
"“Why are these things permitted? What sins have we done? The morning"
"service was over, I was walking through the roads to clear my brain for"
"the afternoon, and then—fire, earthquake, death! As if it were Sodom"
"and Gomorrah! All our work undone, all the work—— What are these"
"Martians?”"
"“What are we?” I answered, clearing my throat."
"He gripped his knees and turned to look at me again. For half a minute,"
"perhaps, he stared silently."
"“I was walking through the roads to clear my brain,” he said. “And"
"suddenly—fire, earthquake, death!”"
"He relapsed into silence, with his chin now sunken almost to his knees."
"Presently he began waving his hand."
"“All the work—all the Sunday schools—What have we done—what has"
"Weybridge done? Everything gone—everything destroyed. The church! We"
"rebuilt it only three years ago. Gone! Swept out of existence! Why?”"
"Another pause, and he broke out again like one demented."
"“The smoke of her burning goeth up for ever and ever!” he shouted."
"His eyes flamed, and he pointed a lean finger in the direction of"
"Weybridge."
"By this time I was beginning to take his measure. The tremendous"
"tragedy in which he had been involved—it was evident he was a fugitive"
"from Weybridge—had driven him to the very verge of his reason."
"“Are we far from Sunbury?” I said, in a matter-of-fact tone."
"“What are we to do?” he asked. “Are these creatures everywhere? Has the"
"earth been given over to them?”"
"“Are we far from Sunbury?”"
"“Only this morning I officiated at early celebration——”"
"“Things have changed,” I said, quietly. “You must keep your head. There"
"is still hope.”"
"“Hope!”"
"“Yes. Plentiful hope—for all this destruction!”"
"I began to explain my view of our position. He listened at first, but"
"as I went on the interest dawning in his eyes gave place to their"
"former stare, and his regard wandered from me."
"“This must be the beginning of the end,” he said, interrupting me. “The"
"end! The great and terrible day of the Lord! When men shall call upon"
"the mountains and the rocks to fall upon them and hide them—hide them"
"from the face of Him that sitteth upon the throne!”"
"I began to understand the position. I ceased my laboured reasoning,"
"struggled to my feet, and, standing over him, laid my hand on his"
"shoulder."
"“Be a man!” said I. “You are scared out of your wits! What good is"
"religion if it collapses under calamity? Think of what earthquakes and"
"floods, wars and volcanoes, have done before to men! Did you think God"
"had exempted Weybridge? He is not an insurance agent.”"
"For a time he sat in blank silence."
"“But how can we escape?” he asked, suddenly. “They are invulnerable,"
"they are pitiless.”"
"“Neither the one nor, perhaps, the other,” I answered. “And the"
"mightier they are the more sane and wary should we be. One of them was"
"killed yonder not three hours ago.”"
"“Killed!” he said, staring about him. “How can God’s ministers be"
"killed?”"
"“I saw it happen.” I proceeded to tell him. “We have chanced to come in"
"for the thick of it,” said I, “and that is all.”"
"“What is that flicker in the sky?” he asked abruptly."
"I told him it was the heliograph signalling—that it was the sign of"
"human help and effort in the sky."
"“We are in the midst of it,” I said, “quiet as it is. That flicker in"
"the sky tells of the gathering storm. Yonder, I take it are the"
"Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and"
"Kingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up and"
"guns are being placed. Presently the Martians will be coming this way"
"again.”"
"And even as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture."
"“Listen!” he said."
"From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of"
"distant guns and a remote weird crying. Then everything was still. A"
"cockchafer came droning over the hedge and past us. High in the west"
"the crescent moon hung faint and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and"
"Shepperton and the hot, still splendour of the sunset."
"“We had better follow this path,” I said, “northward.”"
"XIV."
"IN LONDON."
"My younger brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He"
"was a medical student working for an imminent examination, and he heard"
"nothing of the arrival until Saturday morning. The morning papers on"
"Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy special articles on the"
"planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief and vaguely"
"worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity."
"The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number"
"of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran. The telegram"
"concluded with the words: “Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians"
"have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed,"
"seem incapable of doing so. Probably this is due to the relative"
"strength of the earth’s gravitational energy.” On that last text their"
"leader-writer expanded very comfortingly."
"Of course all the students in the crammer’s biology class, to which my"
"brother went that day, were intensely interested, but there were no"
"signs of any unusual excitement in the streets. The afternoon papers"
"puffed scraps of news under big headlines. They had nothing to tell"
"beyond the movements of troops about the common, and the burning of the"
"pine woods between Woking and Weybridge, until eight. Then the _St."
"James’s Gazette_, in an extra-special edition, announced the bare fact"
"of the interruption of telegraphic communication. This was thought to"
"be due to the falling of burning pine trees across the line. Nothing"
"more of the fighting was known that night, the night of my drive to"
"Leatherhead and back."
"My brother felt no anxiety about us, as he knew from the description in"
"the papers that the cylinder was a good two miles from my house. He"
"made up his mind to run down that night to me, in order, as he says, to"
"see the Things before they were killed. He dispatched a telegram, which"
"never reached me, about four o’clock, and spent the evening at a music"
"hall."
"In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my"
"brother reached Waterloo in a cab. On the platform from which the"
"midnight train usually starts he learned, after some waiting, that an"
"accident prevented trains from reaching Woking that night. The nature"
"of the accident he could not ascertain; indeed, the railway authorities"
"did not clearly know at that time. There was very little excitement in"
"the station, as the officials, failing to realise that anything further"
"than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction had occurred, were"
"running the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by"
"Virginia Water or Guildford. They were busy making the necessary"
"arrangements to alter the route of the Southampton and Portsmouth"
"Sunday League excursions. A nocturnal newspaper reporter, mistaking my"
"brother for the traffic manager, to whom he bears a slight resemblance,"
"waylaid and tried to interview him. Few people, excepting the railway"
"officials, connected the breakdown with the Martians."
"I have read, in another account of these events, that on Sunday morning"
"“all London was electrified by the news from Woking.” As a matter of"
"fact, there was nothing to justify that very extravagant phrase. Plenty"
"of Londoners did not hear of the Martians until the panic of Monday"
"morning. Those who did took some time to realise all that the hastily"
"worded telegrams in the Sunday papers conveyed. The majority of people"
"in London do not read Sunday papers."
"The habit of personal security, moreover, is so deeply fixed in the"
"Londoner’s mind, and startling intelligence so much a matter of course"
"in the papers, that they could read without any personal tremors:"
"“About seven o’clock last night the Martians came out of the cylinder,"
"and, moving about under an armour of metallic shields, have completely"
"wrecked Woking station with the adjacent houses, and massacred an"
"entire battalion of the Cardigan Regiment. No details are known. Maxims"
"have been absolutely useless against their armour; the field guns have"
"been disabled by them. Flying hussars have been galloping into"
"Chertsey. The Martians appear to be moving slowly towards Chertsey or"
"Windsor. Great anxiety prevails in West Surrey, and earthworks are"
"being thrown up to check the advance Londonward.” That was how the"
"_Sunday Sun_ put it, and a clever and remarkably prompt “handbook”"
"article in the _Referee_ compared the affair to a menagerie suddenly"
"let loose in a village."
"No one in London knew positively of the nature of the armoured"
"Martians, and there was still a fixed idea that these monsters must be"
"sluggish: “crawling,” “creeping painfully”—such expressions occurred in"
"almost all the earlier reports. None of the telegrams could have been"
"written by an eyewitness of their advance. The Sunday papers printed"
"separate editions as further news came to hand, some even in default of"
"it. But there was practically nothing more to tell people until late in"
"the afternoon, when the authorities gave the press agencies the news in"
"their possession. It was stated that the people of Walton and"
"Weybridge, and all the district were pouring along the roads"
"Londonward, and that was all."
"My brother went to church at the Foundling Hospital in the morning,"
"still in ignorance of what had happened on the previous night. There he"
"heard allusions made to the invasion, and a special prayer for peace."
"Coming out, he bought a _Referee_. He became alarmed at the news in"
"this, and went again to Waterloo station to find out if communication"
"were restored. The omnibuses, carriages, cyclists, and innumerable"
"people walking in their best clothes seemed scarcely affected by the"
"strange intelligence that the newsvendors were disseminating. People"
"were interested, or, if alarmed, alarmed only on account of the local"
"residents. At the station he heard for the first time that the Windsor"
"and Chertsey lines were now interrupted. The porters told him that"
"several remarkable telegrams had been received in the morning from"
"Byfleet and Chertsey stations, but that these had abruptly ceased. My"
"brother could get very little precise detail out of them."
"“There’s fighting going on about Weybridge” was the extent of their"
"information."
"The train service was now very much disorganised. Quite a number of"
"people who had been expecting friends from places on the South-Western"
"network were standing about the station. One grey-headed old gentleman"
"came and abused the South-Western Company bitterly to my brother. “It"
"wants showing up,” he said."
"One or two trains came in from Richmond, Putney, and Kingston,"
"containing people who had gone out for a day’s boating and found the"
"locks closed and a feeling of panic in the air. A man in a blue and"
"white blazer addressed my brother, full of strange tidings."
"“There’s hosts of people driving into Kingston in traps and carts and"
"things, with boxes of valuables and all that,” he said. “They come from"
"Molesey and Weybridge and Walton, and they say there’s been guns heard"
"at Chertsey, heavy firing, and that mounted soldiers have told them to"
"get off at once because the Martians are coming. We heard guns firing"
"at Hampton Court station, but we thought it was thunder. What the"
"dickens does it all mean? The Martians can’t get out of their pit, can"
"they?”"
"My brother could not tell him."
"Afterwards he found that the vague feeling of alarm had spread to the"
"clients of the underground railway, and that the Sunday excursionists"
"began to return from all over the South-Western “lung”—Barnes,"
"Wimbledon, Richmond Park, Kew, and so forth—at unnaturally early hours;"
"but not a soul had anything more than vague hearsay to tell of."
"Everyone connected with the terminus seemed ill-tempered."
"About five o’clock the gathering crowd in the station was immensely"
"excited by the opening of the line of communication, which is almost"
"invariably closed, between the South-Eastern and the South-Western"
"stations, and the passage of carriage trucks bearing huge guns and"
"carriages crammed with soldiers. These were the guns that were brought"
"up from Woolwich and Chatham to cover Kingston. There was an exchange"
"of pleasantries: “You’ll get eaten!” “We’re the beast-tamers!” and so"
"forth. A little while after that a squad of police came into the"
"station and began to clear the public off the platforms, and my brother"
"went out into the street again."
"The church bells were ringing for evensong, and a squad of Salvation"
"Army lassies came singing down Waterloo Road. On the bridge a number of"
"loafers were watching a curious brown scum that came drifting down the"
"stream in patches. The sun was just setting, and the Clock Tower and"
"the Houses of Parliament rose against one of the most peaceful skies it"
"is possible to imagine, a sky of gold, barred with long transverse"
"stripes of reddish-purple cloud. There was talk of a floating body. One"
"of the men there, a reservist he said he was, told my brother he had"
"seen the heliograph flickering in the west."
"In Wellington Street my brother met a couple of sturdy roughs who had"
"just been rushed out of Fleet Street with still-wet newspapers and"
"staring placards. “Dreadful catastrophe!” they bawled one to the other"
"down Wellington Street. “Fighting at Weybridge! Full description!"
"Repulse of the Martians! London in Danger!” He had to give threepence"
"for a copy of that paper."
"Then it was, and then only, that he realised something of the full"
"power and terror of these monsters. He learned that they were not"
"merely a handful of small sluggish creatures, but that they were minds"
"swaying vast mechanical bodies; and that they could move swiftly and"
"smite with such power that even the mightiest guns could not stand"
"against them."
"They were described as “vast spiderlike machines, nearly a hundred feet"
"high, capable of the speed of an express train, and able to shoot out a"
"beam of intense heat.” Masked batteries, chiefly of field guns, had"
"been planted in the country about Horsell Common, and especially"
"between the Woking district and London. Five of the machines had been"
"seen moving towards the Thames, and one, by a happy chance, had been"
"destroyed. In the other cases the shells had missed, and the batteries"
"had been at once annihilated by the Heat-Rays. Heavy losses of soldiers"
"were mentioned, but the tone of the dispatch was optimistic."
"The Martians had been repulsed; they were not invulnerable. They had"
"retreated to their triangle of cylinders again, in the circle about"
"Woking. Signallers with heliographs were pushing forward upon them from"
"all sides. Guns were in rapid transit from Windsor, Portsmouth,"
"Aldershot, Woolwich—even from the north; among others, long wire-guns"
"of ninety-five tons from Woolwich. Altogether one hundred and sixteen"
"were in position or being hastily placed, chiefly covering London."
"Never before in England had there been such a vast or rapid"
"concentration of military material."
"Any further cylinders that fell, it was hoped, could be destroyed at"
"once by high explosives, which were being rapidly manufactured and"
"distributed. No doubt, ran the report, the situation was of the"
"strangest and gravest description, but the public was exhorted to avoid"
"and discourage panic. No doubt the Martians were strange and terrible"
"in the extreme, but at the outside there could not be more than twenty"
"of them against our millions."
"The authorities had reason to suppose, from the size of the cylinders,"
"that at the outside there could not be more than five in each"
"cylinder—fifteen altogether. And one at least was disposed of—perhaps"
"more. The public would be fairly warned of the approach of danger, and"
"elaborate measures were being taken for the protection of the people in"
"the threatened southwestern suburbs. And so, with reiterated assurances"
"of the safety of London and the ability of the authorities to cope with"
"the difficulty, this quasi-proclamation closed."
"This was printed in enormous type on paper so fresh that it was still"
"wet, and there had been no time to add a word of comment. It was"
"curious, my brother said, to see how ruthlessly the usual contents of"
"the paper had been hacked and taken out to give this place."
"All down Wellington Street people could be seen fluttering out the pink"
"sheets and reading, and the Strand was suddenly noisy with the voices"
"of an army of hawkers following these pioneers. Men came scrambling off"
"buses to secure copies. Certainly this news excited people intensely,"
"whatever their previous apathy. The shutters of a map shop in the"
"Strand were being taken down, my brother said, and a man in his Sunday"
"raiment, lemon-yellow gloves even, was visible inside the window"
"hastily fastening maps of Surrey to the glass."
"Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his hand,"
"my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man"
"with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart"
"such as greengrocers use. He was driving from the direction of"
"Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or"
"six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles. The"
"faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance"
"contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people"
"on the omnibuses. People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of"
"cabs. They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take, and"
"finally turned eastward along the Strand. Some way behind these came a"
"man in workday clothes, riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles"
"with a small front wheel. He was dirty and white in the face."
"My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such"
"people. He had a vague idea that he might see something of me. He"
"noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic. Some of the"
"refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses. One was"
"professing to have seen the Martians. “Boilers on stilts, I tell you,"
"striding along like men.” Most of them were excited and animated by"
"their strange experience."
"Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these"
"arrivals. At all the street corners groups of people were reading"
"papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors."
"They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the roads, my"
"brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day. My brother"
"addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers"
"from most."
"None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who"
"assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous"
"night."
"“I come from Byfleet,” he said; “a man on a bicycle came through the"
"place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to"
"come away. Then came soldiers. We went out to look, and there were"
"clouds of smoke to the south—nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming"
"that way. Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from"
"Weybridge. So I’ve locked up my house and come on.”"
"At that time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the"
"authorities were to blame for their incapacity to dispose of the"
"invaders without all this inconvenience."
"About eight o’clock a noise of heavy firing was distinctly audible all"
"over the south of London. My brother could not hear it for the traffic"
"in the main thoroughfares, but by striking through the quiet back"
"streets to the river he was able to distinguish it quite plainly."
"He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent’s Park, about"
"two. He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at the"
"evident magnitude of the trouble. His mind was inclined to run, even as"
"mine had run on Saturday, on military details. He thought of all those"
"silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried"
"to imagine “boilers on stilts” a hundred feet high."
"There were one or two cartloads of refugees passing along Oxford"
"Street, and several in the Marylebone Road, but so slowly was the news"
"spreading that Regent Street and Portland Place were full of their"
"usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and along"
"the edge of Regent’s Park there were as many silent couples “walking"
"out” together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been. The"
"night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the sound of guns"
"continued intermittently, and after midnight there seemed to be sheet"
"lightning in the south."
"He read and re-read the paper, fearing the worst had happened to me. He"
"was restless, and after supper prowled out again aimlessly. He returned"
"and tried in vain to divert his attention to his examination notes. He"
"went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from lurid dreams"
"in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door knockers, feet"
"running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour of bells. Red"
"reflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay astonished,"
"wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad. Then he jumped"
"out of bed and ran to the window."
"His room was an attic and as he thrust his head out, up and down the"
"street there were a dozen echoes to the noise of his window sash, and"
"heads in every kind of night disarray appeared. Enquiries were being"
"shouted. “They are coming!” bawled a policeman, hammering at the door;"
"“the Martians are coming!” and hurried to the next door."
"The sound of drumming and trumpeting came from the Albany Street"
"Barracks, and every church within earshot was hard at work killing"
"sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin. There was a noise of doors"
"opening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from"
"darkness into yellow illumination."
"Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly into"
"noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window,"
"and dying away slowly in the distance. Close on the rear of this came a"
"couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of flying"
"vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where the"
"North-Western special trains were loading up, instead of coming down"
"the gradient into Euston."
"For a long time my brother stared out of the window in blank"
"astonishment, watching the policemen hammering at door after door, and"
"delivering their incomprehensible message. Then the door behind him"
"opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed only"
"in shirt, trousers, and slippers, his braces loose about his waist, his"
"hair disordered from his pillow."
"“What the devil is it?” he asked. “A fire? What a devil of a row!”"
"They both craned their heads out of the window, straining to hear what"
"the policemen were shouting. People were coming out of the side"
"streets, and standing in groups at the corners talking."
"“What the devil is it all about?” said my brother’s fellow lodger."
"My brother answered him vaguely and began to dress, running with each"
"garment to the window in order to miss nothing of the growing"
"excitement. And presently men selling unnaturally early newspapers came"
"bawling into the street:"
"“London in danger of suffocation! The Kingston and Richmond defences"
"forced! Fearful massacres in the Thames Valley!”"
"And all about him—in the rooms below, in the houses on each side and"
"across the road, and behind in the Park Terraces and in the hundred"
"other streets of that part of Marylebone, and the Westbourne Park"
"district and St. Pancras, and westward and northward in Kilburn and St."
"John’s Wood and Hampstead, and eastward in Shoreditch and Highbury and"
"Haggerston and Hoxton, and, indeed, through all the vastness of London"
"from Ealing to East Ham—people were rubbing their eyes, and opening"
"windows to stare out and ask aimless questions, dressing hastily as the"
"first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets. It"
"was the dawn of the great panic. London, which had gone to bed on"
"Sunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours of"
"Monday morning, to a vivid sense of danger."
"Unable from his window to learn what was happening, my brother went"
"down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of"
"the houses grew pink with the early dawn. The flying people on foot and"
"in vehicles grew more numerous every moment. “Black Smoke!” he heard"
"people crying, and again “Black Smoke!” The contagion of such a"
"unanimous fear was inevitable. As my brother hesitated on the"
"door-step, he saw another newsvendor approaching, and got a paper"
"forthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and selling his"
"papers for a shilling each as he ran—a grotesque mingling of profit and"
"panic."
"And from this paper my brother read that catastrophic dispatch of the"
"Commander-in-Chief:"
"“The Martians are able to discharge enormous clouds of a black and"
"poisonous vapour by means of rockets. They have smothered our"
"batteries, destroyed Richmond, Kingston, and Wimbledon, and are"
"advancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way. It"
"is impossible to stop them. There is no safety from the Black Smoke but"
"in instant flight.”"
"That was all, but it was enough. The whole population of the great"
"six-million city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would be"
"pouring _en masse_ northward."
"“Black Smoke!” the voices cried. “Fire!”"
"The bells of the neighbouring church made a jangling tumult, a cart"
"carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water"
"trough up the street. Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the"
"houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And"
"overhead the dawn was growing brighter, clear and steady and calm."
"He heard footsteps running to and fro in the rooms, and up and down"
"stairs behind him. His landlady came to the door, loosely wrapped in"
"dressing gown and shawl; her husband followed, ejaculating."
"As my brother began to realise the import of all these things, he"
"turned hastily to his own room, put all his available money—some ten"
"pounds altogether—into his pockets, and went out again into the"
"streets."
"XV."
"WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN SURREY."
"It was while the curate had sat and talked so wildly to me under the"
"hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was"
"watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the"
"Martians had resumed the offensive. So far as one can ascertain from"
"the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of them"
"remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that"
"night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green"
"smoke."
"But three certainly came out about eight o’clock and, advancing slowly"
"and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards"
"Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant batteries"
"against the setting sun. These Martians did not advance in a body, but"
"in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow. They"
"communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls, running up"
"and down the scale from one note to another."
"It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St. George’s"
"Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners,"
"unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in"
"such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual volley, and"
"bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village, while the"
"Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over their guns,"
"stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and so came"
"unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed."
"The St. George’s Hill men, however, were better led or of a better"
"mettle. Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been"
"quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them. They laid their guns"
"as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about a"
"thousand yards’ range."
"The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few"
"paces, stagger, and go down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns"
"were reloaded in frantic haste. The overthrown Martian set up a"
"prolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,"
"answering him, appeared over the trees to the south. It would seem that"
"a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells. The whole of"
"the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground, and,"
"simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to bear on"
"the battery. The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about the guns"
"flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were already"
"running over the crest of the hill escaped."
"After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and"
"halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained"
"absolutely stationary for the next half hour. The Martian who had been"
"overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small brown figure,"
"oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight, and"
"apparently engaged in the repair of his support. About nine he had"
"finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees again."
"It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels"
"were joined by four other Martians, each carrying a thick black tube. A"
"similar tube was handed to each of the three, and the seven proceeded"
"to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between"
"St. George’s Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send, southwest of"
"Ripley."
"A dozen rockets sprang out of the hills before them so soon as they"
"began to move, and warned the waiting batteries about Ditton and Esher."
"At the same time four of their fighting machines, similarly armed with"
"tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western"
"sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and"
"painfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford. They"
"moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the"
"fields and rose to a third of their height."
"At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began"
"running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned"
"aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad"
"ditch by the side of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing,"
"and turned to join me."
"The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the"
"remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away"
"towards Staines."
"The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their"
"positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute"
"silence. It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never"
"since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still."
"To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the"
"same effect—the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling"
"night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the afterglow"
"of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St. George’s Hill and the"
"woods of Painshill."
"But facing that crescent everywhere—at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,"
"Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across"
"the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees"
"or village houses gave sufficient cover—the guns were waiting. The"
"signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and"
"vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a"
"tense expectation. The Martians had but to advance into the line of"
"fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns"
"glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a"
"thunderous fury of battle."
"No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant"
"minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle—how much they"
"understood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were"
"organized, disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our"
"spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady"
"investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of"
"onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they might"
"exterminate us? (At that time no one knew what food they needed.) A"
"hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that"
"vast sentinel shape. And in the back of my mind was the sense of all"
"the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward. Had they prepared"
"pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would the"
"Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their"
"mighty province of houses?"
"Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and"
"peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of"
"a gun. Another nearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us"
"raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report"
"that made the ground heave. The one towards Staines answered him. There"
"was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation."
"I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that"
"I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber"
"up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second"
"report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards"
"Hounslow. I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such"
"evidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with"
"one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath."
"And there had been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence was"
"restored; the minute lengthened to three."
"“What has happened?” said the curate, standing up beside me."
"“Heaven knows!” said I."
"A bat flickered by and vanished. A distant tumult of shouting began and"
"ceased. I looked again at the Martian, and saw he was now moving"
"eastward along the riverbank, with a swift, rolling motion."
"Every moment I expected the fire of some hidden battery to spring upon"
"him; but the evening calm was unbroken. The figure of the Martian grew"
"smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering night"
"had swallowed him up. By a common impulse we clambered higher. Towards"
"Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had suddenly"
"come into being there, hiding our view of the farther country; and"
"then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw another such"
"summit. These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared."
"Moved by a sudden thought, I looked northward, and there I perceived a"
"third of these cloudy black kopjes had risen."
"Everything had suddenly become very still. Far away to the southeast,"
"marking the quiet, we heard the Martians hooting to one another, and"
"then the air quivered again with the distant thud of their guns. But"
"the earthly artillery made no reply."
"Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was"
"to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the"
"twilight. Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have"
"described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a"
"huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other"
"possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him. Some fired only"
"one of these, some two—as in the case of the one we had seen; the one"
"at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time."
"These canisters smashed on striking the ground—they did not explode—and"
"incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour,"
"coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous"
"hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country."
"And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was"
"death to all that breathes."
"It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,"
"after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank"
"down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather"
"liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the"
"valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the"
"carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do. And"
"where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface"
"would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and"
"made way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a"
"strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could"
"drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The"
"vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in"
"banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving"
"reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist"
"and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust."
"Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue"
"of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the"
"nature of this substance."
"Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black"
"smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,"
"that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high"
"houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison"
"altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton."
"The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the"
"strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church"
"spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its"
"inky nothingness. For a day and a half he remained there, weary,"
"starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the"
"prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs,"
"green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns,"
"outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight."
"But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to"
"remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground. As a rule the"
"Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again"
"by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it."
"This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight"
"from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had"
"returned. From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and"
"Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled,"
"and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in"
"position there. These continued intermittently for the space of a"
"quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at"
"Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light"
"vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow."
"Then the fourth cylinder fell—a brilliant green meteor—as I learned"
"afterwards, in Bushey Park. Before the guns on the Richmond and"
"Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in"
"the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the"
"black vapour could overwhelm the gunners."
"So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps’"
"nest, the Martians spread this strange stifling vapour over the"
"Londonward country. The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart, until"
"at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night"
"through their destructive tubes advanced. Never once, after the Martian"
"at St. George’s Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery the"
"ghost of a chance against them. Wherever there was a possibility of"
"guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour"
"was discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray"
"was brought to bear."
"By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the"
"glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke,"
"blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the"
"eye could reach. And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned"
"their hissing steam jets this way and that."
"They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they had"
"but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did"
"not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the"
"opposition they had aroused. In the latter aim they certainly"
"succeeded. Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to"
"their movements. After that no body of men would stand against them, so"
"hopeless was the enterprise. Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and"
"destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames refused to"
"stop, mutinied, and went down again. The only offensive operation men"
"ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and"
"pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic."
"One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries"
"towards Esher, waiting so tensely in the twilight. Survivors there were"
"none. One may picture the orderly expectation, the officers alert and"
"watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand, the limber"
"gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of civilian"
"spectators standing as near as they were permitted, the evening"
"stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and"
"wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the"
"Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and"
"houses and smashing amid the neighbouring fields."
"One may picture, too, the sudden shifting of the attention, the swiftly"
"spreading coils and bellyings of that blackness advancing headlong,"
"towering heavenward, turning the twilight to a palpable darkness, a"
"strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims,"
"men and horses near it seen dimly, running, shrieking, falling"
"headlong, shouts of dismay, the guns suddenly abandoned, men choking"
"and writhing on the ground, and the swift broadening-out of the opaque"
"cone of smoke. And then night and extinction—nothing but a silent mass"
"of impenetrable vapour hiding its dead."
"Before dawn the black vapour was pouring through the streets of"
"Richmond, and the disintegrating organism of government was, with a"
"last expiring effort, rousing the population of London to the necessity"
"of flight."
"XVI."
"THE EXODUS FROM LONDON."
"So you understand the roaring wave of fear that swept through the"
"greatest city in the world just as Monday was dawning—the stream of"
"flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round"
"the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the"
"shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel"
"northward and eastward. By ten o’clock the police organisation, and by"
"midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing"
"shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that"
"swift liquefaction of the social body."
"All the railway lines north of the Thames and the South-Eastern people"
"at Cannon Street had been warned by midnight on Sunday, and trains were"
"being filled. People were fighting savagely for standing-room in the"
"carriages even at two o’clock. By three, people were being trampled and"
"crushed even in Bishopsgate Street, a couple of hundred yards or more"
"from Liverpool Street station; revolvers were fired, people stabbed,"
"and the policemen who had been sent to direct the traffic, exhausted"
"and infuriated, were breaking the heads of the people they were called"
"out to protect."
"And as the day advanced and the engine drivers and stokers refused to"
"return to London, the pressure of the flight drove the people in an"
"ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the"
"northward-running roads. By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,"
"and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and"
"across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in"
"its sluggish advance. Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a"
"little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape."
"After a fruitless struggle to get aboard a North-Western train at Chalk"
"Farm—the engines of the trains that had loaded in the goods yard there"
"_ploughed_ through shrieking people, and a dozen stalwart men fought to"
"keep the crowd from crushing the driver against his furnace—my brother"
"emerged upon the Chalk Farm road, dodged across through a hurrying"
"swarm of vehicles, and had the luck to be foremost in the sack of a"
"cycle shop. The front tire of the machine he got was punctured in"
"dragging it through the window, but he got up and off, notwithstanding,"
"with no further injury than a cut wrist. The steep foot of Haverstock"
"Hill was impassable owing to several overturned horses, and my brother"
"struck into Belsize Road."
"So he got out of the fury of the panic, and, skirting the Edgware Road,"
"reached Edgware about seven, fasting and wearied, but well ahead of the"
"crowd. Along the road people were standing in the roadway, curious,"
"wondering. He was passed by a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and"
"two motor cars. A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke, and the"
"machine became unridable. He left it by the roadside and trudged"
"through the village. There were shops half opened in the main street of"
"the place, and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and"
"windows, staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of"
"fugitives that was beginning. He succeeded in getting some food at an"
"inn."
"For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do. The"
"flying people increased in number. Many of them, like my brother,"
"seemed inclined to loiter in the place. There was no fresh news of the"
"invaders from Mars."
"At that time the road was crowded, but as yet far from congested. Most"
"of the fugitives at that hour were mounted on cycles, but there were"
"soon motor cars, hansom cabs, and carriages hurrying along, and the"
"dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans."
"It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where some"
"friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike into a"
"quiet lane running eastward. Presently he came upon a stile, and,"
"crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward. He passed near several"
"farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn. He saw"
"few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he happened"
"upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers. He came upon them"
"just in time to save them."
"He heard their screams, and, hurrying round the corner, saw a couple of"
"men struggling to drag them out of the little pony-chaise in which they"
"had been driving, while a third with difficulty held the frightened"
"pony’s head. One of the ladies, a short woman dressed in white, was"
"simply screaming; the other, a dark, slender figure, slashed at the man"
"who gripped her arm with a whip she held in her disengaged hand."
"My brother immediately grasped the situation, shouted, and hurried"
"towards the struggle. One of the men desisted and turned towards him,"
"and my brother, realising from his antagonist’s face that a fight was"
"unavoidable, and being an expert boxer, went into him forthwith and"
"sent him down against the wheel of the chaise."
"It was no time for pugilistic chivalry and my brother laid him quiet"
"with a kick, and gripped the collar of the man who pulled at the"
"slender lady’s arm. He heard the clatter of hoofs, the whip stung"
"across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and"
"the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the"
"direction from which he had come."
"Partly stunned, he found himself facing the man who had held the"
"horse’s head, and became aware of the chaise receding from him down the"
"lane, swaying from side to side, and with the women in it looking back."
"The man before him, a burly rough, tried to close, and he stopped him"
"with a blow in the face. Then, realising that he was deserted, he"
"dodged round and made off down the lane after the chaise, with the"
"sturdy man close behind him, and the fugitive, who had turned now,"
"following remotely."
"Suddenly he stumbled and fell; his immediate pursuer went headlong, and"
"he rose to his feet to find himself with a couple of antagonists again."
"He would have had little chance against them had not the slender lady"
"very pluckily pulled up and returned to his help. It seems she had had"
"a revolver all this time, but it had been under the seat when she and"
"her companion were attacked. She fired at six yards’ distance, narrowly"
"missing my brother. The less courageous of the robbers made off, and"
"his companion followed him, cursing his cowardice. They both stopped in"
"sight down the lane, where the third man lay insensible."
"“Take this!” said the slender lady, and she gave my brother her"
"revolver."
"“Go back to the chaise,” said my brother, wiping the blood from his"
"split lip."
"She turned without a word—they were both panting—and they went back to"
"where the lady in white struggled to hold back the frightened pony."
"The robbers had evidently had enough of it. When my brother looked"
"again they were retreating."
"“I’ll sit here,” said my brother, “if I may”; and he got upon the empty"
"front seat. The lady looked over her shoulder."
"“Give me the reins,” she said, and laid the whip along the pony’s side."
"In another moment a bend in the road hid the three men from my"
"brother’s eyes."
"So, quite unexpectedly, my brother found himself, panting, with a cut"
"mouth, a bruised jaw, and bloodstained knuckles, driving along an"
"unknown lane with these two women."
"He learned they were the wife and the younger sister of a surgeon"
"living at Stanmore, who had come in the small hours from a dangerous"
"case at Pinner, and heard at some railway station on his way of the"
"Martian advance. He had hurried home, roused the women—their servant"
"had left them two days before—packed some provisions, put his revolver"
"under the seat—luckily for my brother—and told them to drive on to"
"Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there. He stopped behind to"
"tell the neighbours. He would overtake them, he said, at about half"
"past four in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had seen"
"nothing of him. They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing"
"traffic through the place, and so they had come into this side lane."
"That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently"
"they stopped again, nearer to New Barnet. He promised to stay with"
"them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the"
"missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the"
"revolver—a weapon strange to him—in order to give them confidence."
"They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became"
"happy in the hedge. He told them of his own escape out of London, and"
"all that he knew of these Martians and their ways. The sun crept higher"
"in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an"
"uneasy state of anticipation. Several wayfarers came along the lane,"
"and of these my brother gathered such news as he could. Every broken"
"answer he had deepened his impression of the great disaster that had"
"come on humanity, deepened his persuasion of the immediate necessity"
"for prosecuting this flight. He urged the matter upon them."
"“We have money,” said the slender woman, and hesitated."
"Her eyes met my brother’s, and her hesitation ended."
"“So have I,” said my brother."
"She explained that they had as much as thirty pounds in gold, besides a"
"five-pound note, and suggested that with that they might get upon a"
"train at St. Albans or New Barnet. My brother thought that was"
"hopeless, seeing the fury of the Londoners to crowd upon the trains,"
"and broached his own idea of striking across Essex towards Harwich and"
"thence escaping from the country altogether."
"Mrs. Elphinstone—that was the name of the woman in white—would listen"
"to no reasoning, and kept calling upon “George”; but her sister-in-law"
"was astonishingly quiet and deliberate, and at last agreed to my"
"brother’s suggestion. So, designing to cross the Great North Road, they"
"went on towards Barnet, my brother leading the pony to save it as much"
"as possible. As the sun crept up the sky the day became excessively"
"hot, and under foot a thick, whitish sand grew burning and blinding, so"
"that they travelled only very slowly. The hedges were grey with dust."
"And as they advanced towards Barnet a tumultuous murmuring grew"
"stronger."
"They began to meet more people. For the most part these were staring"
"before them, murmuring indistinct questions, jaded, haggard, unclean."
"One man in evening dress passed them on foot, his eyes on the ground."
"They heard his voice, and, looking back at him, saw one hand clutched"
"in his hair and the other beating invisible things. His paroxysm of"
"rage over, he went on his way without once looking back."
"As my brother’s party went on towards the crossroads to the south of"
"Barnet they saw a woman approaching the road across some fields on"
"their left, carrying a child and with two other children; and then"
"passed a man in dirty black, with a thick stick in one hand and a small"
"portmanteau in the other. Then round the corner of the lane, from"
"between the villas that guarded it at its confluence with the high"
"road, came a little cart drawn by a sweating black pony and driven by a"
"sallow youth in a bowler hat, grey with dust. There were three girls,"
"East End factory girls, and a couple of little children crowded in the"
"cart."
"“This’ll tike us rahnd Edgware?” asked the driver, wild-eyed,"
"white-faced; and when my brother told him it would if he turned to the"
"left, he whipped up at once without the formality of thanks."
"My brother noticed a pale grey smoke or haze rising among the houses in"
"front of them, and veiling the white façade of a terrace beyond the"
"road that appeared between the backs of the villas. Mrs. Elphinstone"
"suddenly cried out at a number of tongues of smoky red flame leaping up"
"above the houses in front of them against the hot, blue sky. The"
"tumultuous noise resolved itself now into the disorderly mingling of"
"many voices, the gride of many wheels, the creaking of waggons, and the"
"staccato of hoofs. The lane came round sharply not fifty yards from the"
"crossroads."
"“Good heavens!” cried Mrs. Elphinstone. “What is this you are driving"
"us into?”"
"My brother stopped."
"For the main road was a boiling stream of people, a torrent of human"
"beings rushing northward, one pressing on another. A great bank of"
"dust, white and luminous in the blaze of the sun, made everything"
"within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was"
"perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and"
"of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every"
"description."
"“Way!” my brother heard voices crying. “Make way!”"
"It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting"
"point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust"
"was hot and pungent. And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa was"
"burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to"
"add to the confusion."
"Two men came past them. Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy bundle and"
"weeping. A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously"
"round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my brother’s threat."
"So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to"
"the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent in"
"between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded forms,"
"grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past,"
"and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was"
"swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust."
"“Go on! Go on!” cried the voices. “Way! Way!”"
"One man’s hands pressed on the back of another. My brother stood at the"
"pony’s head. Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace by pace,"
"down the lane."
"Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but"
"this was a whole population in movement. It is hard to imagine that"
"host. It had no character of its own. The figures poured out past the"
"corner, and receded with their backs to the group in the lane. Along"
"the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels,"
"stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another."
"The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making little"
"way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward"
"every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so,"
"sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the"
"villas."
"“Push on!” was the cry. “Push on! They are coming!”"
"In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,"
"gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, “Eternity!"
"Eternity!” His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could"
"hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust. Some of the"
"people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and"
"quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing"
"with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay"
"prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances. The horses’ bits were"
"covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot."
"There were cabs, carriages, shop-carts, waggons, beyond counting; a"
"mail cart, a road-cleaner’s cart marked “Vestry of St. Pancras,” a huge"
"timber waggon crowded with roughs. A brewer’s dray rumbled by with its"
"two near wheels splashed with fresh blood."
"“Clear the way!” cried the voices. “Clear the way!”"
"“Eter-nity! Eter-nity!” came echoing down the road."
"There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children"
"that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their"
"weary faces smeared with tears. With many of these came men, sometimes"
"helpful, sometimes lowering and savage. Fighting side by side with them"
"pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed,"
"loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed. There were sturdy workmen thrusting"
"their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks or shopmen,"
"struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed, men"
"dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a"
"nightshirt with a coat thrown over it."
"But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had in"
"common. There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind them."
"A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent the whole"
"host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken"
"that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed"
"activity. The heat and dust had already been at work upon this"
"multitude. Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked. They"
"were all thirsty, weary, and footsore. And amid the various cries one"
"heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices"
"of most of them were hoarse and weak. Through it all ran a refrain:"
"“Way! Way! The Martians are coming!”"
"Few stopped and came aside from that flood. The lane opened slantingly"
"into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance"
"of coming from the direction of London. Yet a kind of eddy of people"
"drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the"
"most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again. A little"
"way down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man with a"
"bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. He was a lucky man to have"
"friends."
"A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black"
"frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his"
"boot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble, and hobbled on"
"again; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw"
"herself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping."
"“I can’t go on! I can’t go on!”"
"My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,"
"speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone. So soon as"
"my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened."
"“Ellen!” shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her"
"voice—“Ellen!” And the child suddenly darted away from my brother,"
"crying “Mother!”"
"“They are coming,” said a man on horseback, riding past along the lane."
"“Out of the way, there!” bawled a coachman, towering high; and my"
"brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane."
"The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse. My brother"
"pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man drove by"
"and stopped at the turn of the way. It was a carriage, with a pole for"
"a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces. My brother saw dimly"
"through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher"
"and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge."
"One of the men came running to my brother."
"“Where is there any water?” he said. “He is dying fast, and very"
"thirsty. It is Lord Garrick.”"
"“Lord Garrick!” said my brother; “the Chief Justice?”"
"“The water?” he said."
"“There may be a tap,” said my brother, “in some of the houses. We have"
"no water. I dare not leave my people.”"
"The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house."
"“Go on!” said the people, thrusting at him. “They are coming! Go on!”"
"Then my brother’s attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced"
"man lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother’s eyes"
"rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up"
"into separate coins as it struck the ground. They rolled hither and"
"thither among the struggling feet of men and horses. The man stopped"
"and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab struck his"
"shoulder and sent him reeling. He gave a shriek and dodged back, and a"
"cartwheel shaved him narrowly."
"“Way!” cried the men all about him. “Make way!”"
"So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands open,"
"upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket. A"
"horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half rising, he had"
"been borne down under the horse’s hoofs."
"“Stop!” screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way, tried"
"to clutch the bit of the horse."
"Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw"
"through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch’s back. The"
"driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round behind"
"the cart. The multitudinous shouting confused his ears. The man was"
"writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to rise, for the"
"wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp and dead. My"
"brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a man on a black"
"horse came to his assistance."
"“Get him out of the road,” said he; and, clutching the man’s collar"
"with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways. But he still"
"clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering"
"at his arm with a handful of gold. “Go on! Go on!” shouted angry voices"
"behind. “Way! Way!”"
"There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that"
"the man on horseback stopped. My brother looked up, and the man with"
"the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar."
"There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways,"
"and the carthorse pushed beside it. A hoof missed my brother’s foot by"
"a hair’s breadth. He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped"
"back. He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on"
"the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne"
"backward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight"
"hard in the torrent to recover it."
"He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all"
"a child’s want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at"
"a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under"
"the rolling wheels. “Let us go back!” he shouted, and began turning the"
"pony round. “We cannot cross this—hell,” he said and they went back a"
"hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting crowd was"
"hidden. As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of"
"the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white and drawn,"
"and shining with perspiration. The two women sat silent, crouching in"
"their seat and shivering."
"Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again. Miss Elphinstone was"
"white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to"
"call upon “George.” My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as"
"they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to"
"attempt this crossing. He turned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly"
"resolute."
"“We must go that way,” he said, and led the pony round again."
"For the second time that day this girl proved her quality. To force"
"their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the"
"traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its"
"head. A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter"
"from the chaise. In another moment they were caught and swept forward"
"by the stream. My brother, with the cabman’s whip marks red across his"
"face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her."
"“Point the revolver at the man behind,” he said, giving it to her, “if"
"he presses us too hard. No!—point it at his horse.”"
"Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across"
"the road. But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, to become"
"a part of that dusty rout. They swept through Chipping Barnet with the"
"torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before"
"they had fought across to the opposite side of the way. It was din and"
"confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks"
"repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the stress."
"They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of the"
"road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude"
"of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at the water."
"And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw two trains"
"running slowly one after the other without signal or order—trains"
"swarming with people, with men even among the coals behind the"
"engines—going northward along the Great Northern Railway. My brother"
"supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that time the"
"furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini"
"impossible."
"Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the"
"violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them."
"They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and"
"none of them dared to sleep. And in the evening many people came"
"hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from"
"unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my"
"brother had come."
"XVII."
"THE “THUNDER CHILD”."
"Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday have"
"annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself slowly"
"through the home counties. Not only along the road through Barnet, but"
"also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to"
"Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames to Deal and"
"Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout. If one could have hung that"
"June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London every"
"northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets"
"would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives, each dot"
"a human agony of terror and physical distress. I have set forth at"
"length in the last chapter my brother’s account of the road through"
"Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming"
"of black dots appeared to one of those concerned. Never before in the"
"history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered"
"together. The legendary hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia"
"has ever seen, would have been but a drop in that current. And this was"
"no disciplined march; it was a stampede—a stampede gigantic and"
"terrible—without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed"
"and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout"
"of civilisation, of the massacre of mankind."
"Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of"
"streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,"
"gardens—already derelict—spread out like a huge map, and in the"
"southward _blotted_. Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would have"
"seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart. Steadily,"
"incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out"
"ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising"
"ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,"
"exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper."
"And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river, the"
"glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically spreading"
"their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that,"
"laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose,"
"and taking possession of the conquered country. They do not seem to"
"have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and"
"the destruction of any opposition. They exploded any stores of powder"
"they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked the railways here and"
"there. They were hamstringing mankind. They seemed in no hurry to"
"extend the field of their operations, and did not come beyond the"
"central part of London all that day. It is possible that a very"
"considerable number of people in London stuck to their houses through"
"Monday morning. Certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the"
"Black Smoke."
"Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene."
"Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous"
"sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many who swam"
"out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned. About"
"one o’clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the"
"black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that"
"the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and"
"for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern"
"arch of the Tower Bridge, and the sailors and lightermen had to fight"
"savagely against the people who swarmed upon them from the riverfront."
"People were actually clambering down the piers of the bridge from"
"above."
"When, an hour later, a Martian appeared beyond the Clock Tower and"
"waded down the river, nothing but wreckage floated above Limehouse."
"Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell. The"
"sixth star fell at Wimbledon. My brother, keeping watch beside the"
"women in the chaise in a meadow, saw the green flash of it far beyond"
"the hills. On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across"
"the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester."
"The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of"
"London was confirmed. They had been seen at Highgate, and even, it was"
"said, at Neasden. But they did not come into my brother’s view until"
"the morrow."
"That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of"
"provisions. As they grew hungry the rights of property ceased to be"
"regarded. Farmers were out to defend their cattle-sheds, granaries, and"
"ripening root crops with arms in their hands. A number of people now,"
"like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there were some"
"desperate souls even going back towards London to get food. These were"
"chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge of the Black"
"Smoke came by hearsay. He heard that about half the members of the"
"government had gathered at Birmingham, and that enormous quantities of"
"high explosives were being prepared to be used in automatic mines"
"across the Midland counties."
"He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the"
"desertions of the first day’s panic, had resumed traffic, and was"
"running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of"
"the home counties. There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar"
"announcing that large stores of flour were available in the northern"
"towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed"
"among the starving people in the neighbourhood. But this intelligence"
"did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three"
"pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution"
"than this promise. Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear more"
"of it. That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose Hill. It"
"fell while Miss Elphinstone was watching, for she took that duty"
"alternately with my brother. She saw it."
"On Wednesday the three fugitives—they had passed the night in a field"
"of unripe wheat—reached Chelmsford, and there a body of the"
"inhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the"
"pony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the"
"promise of a share in it the next day. Here there were rumours of"
"Martians at Epping, and news of the destruction of Waltham Abbey Powder"
"Mills in a vain attempt to blow up one of the invaders."
"People were watching for Martians here from the church towers. My"
"brother, very luckily for him as it chanced, preferred to push on at"
"once to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of them"
"were very hungry. By midday they passed through Tillingham, which,"
"strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save for a"
"few furtive plunderers hunting for food. Near Tillingham they suddenly"
"came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all"
"sorts that it is possible to imagine."
"For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came on"
"to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afterwards"
"to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people. They lay in a huge"
"sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze."
"Close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks—English, Scotch,"
"French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames, yachts,"
"electric boats; and beyond were ships of larger burden, a multitude of"
"filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats,"
"petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even, neat white"
"and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast"
"across the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of"
"boats chaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also"
"extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon."
"About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,"
"almost, to my brother’s perception, like a water-logged ship. This was"
"the ram _Thunder Child_. It was the only warship in sight, but far away"
"to the right over the smooth surface of the sea—for that day there was"
"a dead calm—lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of"
"the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line, steam up and"
"ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the course of the"
"Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it."
"At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the assurances"
"of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic. She had never been out of"
"England before, she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a"
"foreign country, and so forth. She seemed, poor woman, to imagine that"
"the French and the Martians might prove very similar. She had been"
"growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed during the two"
"days’ journeyings. Her great idea was to return to Stanmore. Things had"
"been always well and safe at Stanmore. They would find George at"
"Stanmore...."
"It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the"
"beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention"
"of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames. They sent a boat and"
"drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three. The steamer was"
"going, these men said, to Ostend."
"It was about two o’clock when my brother, having paid their fares at"
"the gangway, found himself safely aboard the steamboat with his"
"charges. There was food aboard, albeit at exorbitant prices, and the"
"three of them contrived to eat a meal on one of the seats forward."
"There were already a couple of score of passengers aboard, some of whom"
"had expended their last money in securing a passage, but the captain"
"lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up"
"passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded. He"
"would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of"
"guns that began about that hour in the south. As if in answer, the"
"ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags. A jet"
"of smoke sprang out of her funnels."
"Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from"
"Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the"
"same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three"
"ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of"
"black smoke. But my brother’s attention speedily reverted to the"
"distant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising"
"out of the distant grey haze."
"The little steamer was already flapping her way eastward of the big"
"crescent of shipping, and the low Essex coast was growing blue and"
"hazy, when a Martian appeared, small and faint in the remote distance,"
"advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness. At that"
"the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and"
"anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his"
"terror. Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the"
"steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or"
"church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human"
"stride."
"It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed"
"than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the"
"shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell"
"away. Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over"
"some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading"
"deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between"
"sea and sky. They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the"
"escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness"
"and the Naze. In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the"
"little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind"
"her, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance."
"Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of shipping"
"already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind"
"another, another coming round from broadside to end on, steamships"
"whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let out,"
"launches rushing hither and thither. He was so fascinated by this and"
"by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for"
"anything seaward. And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had"
"suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from"
"the seat upon which he was standing. There was a shouting all about"
"him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered"
"faintly. The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands."
"He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards"
"from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a"
"plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge"
"waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles"
"helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the"
"waterline."
"A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were"
"clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big"
"iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin"
"funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the"
"torpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue"
"of the threatened shipping."
"Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my"
"brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again, and"
"he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far out to"
"sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged. Thus"
"sunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less"
"formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was"
"pitching so helplessly. It would seem they were regarding this new"
"antagonist with astonishment. To their intelligence, it may be, the"
"giant was even such another as themselves. The _Thunder Child_ fired no"
"gun, but simply drove full speed towards them. It was probably her not"
"firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did. They did"
"not know what to make of her. One shell, and they would have sent her"
"to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray."
"She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway"
"between the steamboat and the Martians—a diminishing black bulk against"
"the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast."
"Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a"
"canister of the black gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and"
"glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding"
"torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the"
"watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their"
"eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians."
"They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as"
"they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like"
"generator of the Heat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and"
"a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch. It must have driven"
"through the iron of the ship’s side like a white-hot iron rod through"
"paper."
"A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the"
"Martian reeled and staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a"
"great body of water and steam shot high in the air. The guns of the"
"_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the"
"other, and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer,"
"ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a"
"smack to matchwood."
"But no one heeded that very much. At the sight of the Martian’s"
"collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the"
"crowding passengers on the steamer’s stern shouted together. And then"
"they yelled again. For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove"
"something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,"
"its ventilators and funnels spouting fire."
"She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and her"
"engines working. She headed straight for a second Martian, and was"
"within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with"
"a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped"
"upward. The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and"
"in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the"
"impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of"
"cardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boiling tumult of steam"
"hid everything again."
"“Two!” yelled the captain."
"Everyone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with"
"frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the"
"crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea."
"The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third"
"Martian and the coast altogether. And all this time the boat was"
"paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last"
"the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,"
"and nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the"
"third Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were now quite"
"close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat."
"The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads"
"receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled"
"bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in"
"the strangest way. The fleet of refugees was scattering to the"
"northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the"
"steamboat. After a time, and before they reached the sinking cloud"
"bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went about and"
"passed into the thickening haze of evening southward. The coast grew"
"faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that"
"were gathering about the sinking sun."
"Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration"
"of guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the"
"rail of the steamer and peered into the blinding furnace of the west,"
"but nothing was to be distinguished clearly. A mass of smoke rose"
"slanting and barred the face of the sun. The steamboat throbbed on its"
"way through an interminable suspense."
"The sun sank into grey clouds, the sky flushed and darkened, the"
"evening star trembled into sight. It was deep twilight when the captain"
"cried out and pointed. My brother strained his eyes. Something rushed"
"up into the sky out of the greyness—rushed slantingly upward and very"
"swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western"
"sky; something flat and broad, and very large, that swept round in a"
"vast curve, grew smaller, sank slowly, and vanished again into the grey"
"mystery of the night. And as it flew it rained down darkness upon the"
"land."
"BOOK TWO"
"THE EARTH UNDER THE MARTIANS."
"I."
"UNDER FOOT."
"In the first book I have wandered so much from my own adventures to"
"tell of the experiences of my brother that all through the last two"
"chapters I and the curate have been lurking in the empty house at"
"Halliford whither we fled to escape the Black Smoke. There I will"
"resume. We stopped there all Sunday night and all the next day—the day"
"of the panic—in a little island of daylight, cut off by the Black Smoke"
"from the rest of the world. We could do nothing but wait in aching"
"inactivity during those two weary days."
"My mind was occupied by anxiety for my wife. I figured her at"
"Leatherhead, terrified, in danger, mourning me already as a dead man. I"
"paced the rooms and cried aloud when I thought of how I was cut off"
"from her, of all that might happen to her in my absence. My cousin I"
"knew was brave enough for any emergency, but he was not the sort of man"
"to realise danger quickly, to rise promptly. What was needed now was"
"not bravery, but circumspection. My only consolation was to believe"
"that the Martians were moving Londonward and away from her. Such vague"
"anxieties keep the mind sensitive and painful. I grew very weary and"
"irritable with the curate’s perpetual ejaculations; I tired of the"
"sight of his selfish despair. After some ineffectual remonstrance I"
"kept away from him, staying in a room—evidently a children’s"
"schoolroom—containing globes, forms, and copybooks. When he followed me"
"thither, I went to a box room at the top of the house and, in order to"
"be alone with my aching miseries, locked myself in."
"We were hopelessly hemmed in by the Black Smoke all that day and the"
"morning of the next. There were signs of people in the next house on"
"Sunday evening—a face at a window and moving lights, and later the"
"slamming of a door. But I do not know who these people were, nor what"
"became of them. We saw nothing of them next day. The Black Smoke"
"drifted slowly riverward all through Monday morning, creeping nearer"
"and nearer to us, driving at last along the roadway outside the house"
"that hid us."
"A Martian came across the fields about midday, laying the stuff with a"
"jet of superheated steam that hissed against the walls, smashed all the"
"windows it touched, and scalded the curate’s hand as he fled out of the"
"front room. When at last we crept across the sodden rooms and looked"
"out again, the country northward was as though a black snowstorm had"
"passed over it. Looking towards the river, we were astonished to see an"
"unaccountable redness mingling with the black of the scorched meadows."
"For a time we did not see how this change affected our position, save"
"that we were relieved of our fear of the Black Smoke. But later I"
"perceived that we were no longer hemmed in, that now we might get away."
"So soon as I realised that the way of escape was open, my dream of"
"action returned. But the curate was lethargic, unreasonable."
"“We are safe here,” he repeated; “safe here.”"
"I resolved to leave him—would that I had! Wiser now for the"
"artilleryman’s teaching, I sought out food and drink. I had found oil"
"and rags for my burns, and I also took a hat and a flannel shirt that I"
"found in one of the bedrooms. When it was clear to him that I meant to"
"go alone—had reconciled myself to going alone—he suddenly roused"
"himself to come. And all being quiet throughout the afternoon, we"
"started about five o’clock, as I should judge, along the blackened road"
"to Sunbury."
"In Sunbury, and at intervals along the road, were dead bodies lying in"
"contorted attitudes, horses as well as men, overturned carts and"
"luggage, all covered thickly with black dust. That pall of cindery"
"powder made me think of what I had read of the destruction of Pompeii."
"We got to Hampton Court without misadventure, our minds full of strange"
"and unfamiliar appearances, and at Hampton Court our eyes were relieved"
"to find a patch of green that had escaped the suffocating drift. We"
"went through Bushey Park, with its deer going to and fro under the"
"chestnuts, and some men and women hurrying in the distance towards"
"Hampton, and so we came to Twickenham. These were the first people we"
"saw."
"Away across the road the woods beyond Ham and Petersham were still"
"afire. Twickenham was uninjured by either Heat-Ray or Black Smoke, and"
"there were more people about here, though none could give us news. For"
"the most part they were like ourselves, taking advantage of a lull to"
"shift their quarters. I have an impression that many of the houses here"
"were still occupied by scared inhabitants, too frightened even for"
"flight. Here too the evidence of a hasty rout was abundant along the"
"road. I remember most vividly three smashed bicycles in a heap, pounded"
"into the road by the wheels of subsequent carts. We crossed Richmond"
"Bridge about half past eight. We hurried across the exposed bridge, of"
"course, but I noticed floating down the stream a number of red masses,"
"some many feet across. I did not know what these were—there was no time"
"for scrutiny—and I put a more horrible interpretation on them than they"
"deserved. Here again on the Surrey side were black dust that had once"
"been smoke, and dead bodies—a heap near the approach to the station;"
"but we had no glimpse of the Martians until we were some way towards"
"Barnes."
"We saw in the blackened distance a group of three people running down a"
"side street towards the river, but otherwise it seemed deserted. Up the"
"hill Richmond town was burning briskly; outside the town of Richmond"
"there was no trace of the Black Smoke."
"Then suddenly, as we approached Kew, came a number of people running,"
"and the upperworks of a Martian fighting-machine loomed in sight over"
"the housetops, not a hundred yards away from us. We stood aghast at our"
"danger, and had the Martian looked down we must immediately have"
"perished. We were so terrified that we dared not go on, but turned"
"aside and hid in a shed in a garden. There the curate crouched, weeping"
"silently, and refusing to stir again."
"But my fixed idea of reaching Leatherhead would not let me rest, and in"
"the twilight I ventured out again. I went through a shrubbery, and"
"along a passage beside a big house standing in its own grounds, and so"
"emerged upon the road towards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but"
"he came hurrying after me."
"That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did. For it was"
"manifest the Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken"
"me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or"
"another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge."
"Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the"
"green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian"
"pursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran"
"radiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to"
"destroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them"
"into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a"
"workman’s basket hangs over his shoulder."
"It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any other"
"purpose than destruction with defeated humanity. We stood for a moment"
"petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled"
"garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there,"
"scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out."
"I suppose it was nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered courage to"
"start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along"
"hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the"
"darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who"
"seemed to be all about us. In one place we blundered upon a scorched"
"and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered"
"dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with"
"their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet,"
"perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages."
"Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent and"
"deserted. Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too dark"
"for us to see into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my companion"
"suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one"
"of the houses."
"The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the window,"
"was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in"
"the place but some mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink;"
"and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our next"
"house-breaking."
"We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake. Here"
"there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of"
"this domicile we found a store of food—two loaves of bread in a pan, an"
"uncooked steak, and the half of a ham. I give this catalogue so"
"precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to subsist upon"
"this store for the next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf,"
"and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This"
"pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in this was firewood;"
"there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly a dozen of"
"burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of biscuits."
"We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark—for we dared not strike a"
"light—and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle. The"
"curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for"
"pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when"
"the thing happened that was to imprison us."
"“It can’t be midnight yet,” I said, and then came a blinding glare of"
"vivid green light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly"
"visible in green and black, and vanished again. And then followed such"
"a concussion as I have never heard before or since. So close on the"
"heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash"
"of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the"
"plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of"
"fragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across the floor"
"against the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a long time,"
"the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and"
"he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from a cut"
"forehead, was dabbing water over me."
"For some time I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came"
"to me slowly. A bruise on my temple asserted itself."
"“Are you better?” asked the curate in a whisper."
"At last I answered him. I sat up."
"“Don’t move,” he said. “The floor is covered with smashed crockery from"
"the dresser. You can’t possibly move without making a noise, and I"
"fancy _they_ are outside.”"
"We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other"
"breathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us,"
"some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound."
"Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle."
"“That!” said the curate, when presently it happened again."
"“Yes,” I said. “But what is it?”"
"“A Martian!” said the curate."
"I listened again."
"“It was not like the Heat-Ray,” I said, and for a time I was inclined"
"to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the"
"house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of Shepperton"
"Church."
"Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or"
"four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved. And then the light"
"filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through"
"a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the"
"wall behind us. The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the"
"first time."
"The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed"
"over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet."
"Outside, the soil was banked high against the house. At the top of the"
"window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe. The floor was littered"
"with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was"
"broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was evident the"
"greater part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly with this"
"ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with"
"a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating"
"blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering"
"from the walls above the kitchen range."
"As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the body"
"of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still glowing"
"cylinder. At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible"
"out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery."
"Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind."
"“The fifth cylinder,” I whispered, “the fifth shot from Mars, has"
"struck this house and buried us under the ruins!”"
"For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:"
"“God have mercy upon us!”"
"I heard him presently whimpering to himself."
"Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part"
"scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of"
"the kitchen door. I could just see the curate’s face, a dim, oval"
"shape, and his collar and cuffs. Outside there began a metallic"
"hammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet"
"interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine. These noises, for"
"the most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if"
"anything to increase in number as time wore on. Presently a measured"
"thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the"
"vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued. Once the"
"light was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely"
"dark. For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and shivering,"
"until our tired attention failed. . . ."
"At last I found myself awake and very hungry. I am inclined to believe"
"we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening."
"My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action. I"
"told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way towards the"
"pantry. He made me no answer, but so soon as I began eating the faint"
"noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling after me."
"II."
"WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE."
"After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have dozed"
"again, for when presently I looked round I was alone. The thudding"
"vibration continued with wearisome persistence. I whispered for the"
"curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of the"
"kitchen. It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the room,"
"lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians."
"His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden from me."
"I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed;"
"and the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the aperture in"
"the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm"
"blue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching"
"the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with extreme"
"care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor."
"I touched the curate’s leg, and he started so violently that a mass of"
"plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact. I"
"gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we"
"crouched motionless. Then I turned to see how much of our rampart"
"remained. The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open"
"in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was"
"able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet"
"suburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld."
"The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house"
"we had first visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed,"
"pulverised, and dispersed by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath"
"the original foundations—deep in a hole, already vastly larger than the"
"pit I had looked into at Woking. The earth all round it had splashed"
"under that tremendous impact—“splashed” is the only word—and lay in"
"heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses. It had behaved"
"exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer. Our house had"
"collapsed backward; the front portion, even on the ground floor, had"
"been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had"
"escaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in by tons"
"of earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect we"
"hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were"
"engaged in making. The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind"
"us, and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil"
"across our peephole."
"The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on the"
"farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery,"
"one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood"
"stiff and tall against the evening sky. At first I scarcely noticed the"
"pit and the cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them"
"first, on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy"
"in the excavation, and on account of the strange creatures that were"
"crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it."
"The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first. It was one"
"of those complicated fabrics that have since been called"
"handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an"
"enormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first,"
"it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs,"
"and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars, and reaching"
"and clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were"
"retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of"
"rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently"
"strengthened the walls of the cylinder. These, as it extracted them,"
"were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it."
"Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not"
"see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The"
"fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary"
"pitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen"
"these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or"
"the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,"
"scarcely realise that living quality."
"I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to"
"give a consecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a"
"hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge"
"ended. He presented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either"
"flexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of"
"effect. The pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable"
"vogue, and I mention them here simply to warn the reader against the"
"impression they may have created. They were no more like the Martians I"
"saw in action than a Dutch doll is like a human being. To my mind, the"
"pamphlet would have been much better without them."
"At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine,"
"but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the"
"controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements"
"seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab’s cerebral portion. But"
"then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery"
"integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true"
"nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With that realisation"
"my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians."
"Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea"
"no longer obscured my observation. Moreover, I was concealed and"
"motionless, and under no urgency of action."
"They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to"
"conceive. They were huge round bodies—or, rather, heads—about four feet"
"in diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had no"
"nostrils—indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of"
"smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just"
"beneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body—I"
"scarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface,"
"since known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost"
"useless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteen"
"slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight"
"each. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that"
"distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_. Even as I saw"
"these Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to"
"raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased"
"weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is reason"
"to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some"
"facility."
"The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown,"
"was almost equally simple. The greater part of the structure was the"
"brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles."
"Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the"
"heart and its vessels. The pulmonary distress caused by the denser"
"atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in"
"the convulsive movements of the outer skin."
"And this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a"
"human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the"
"bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians. They were"
"heads—merely heads. Entrails they had none. They did not eat, much less"
"digest. Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures,"
"and _injected_ it into their own veins. I have myself seen this being"
"done, as I shall mention in its place. But, squeamish as I may seem, I"
"cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to"
"continue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from a still"
"living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run directly by"
"means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . ."
"The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the"
"same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous"
"habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit."
"The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are"
"undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and"
"energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process. Our bodies are"
"half made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning"
"heterogeneous food into blood. The digestive processes and their"
"reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds."
"Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers, or"
"sound gastric glands. But the Martians were lifted above all these"
"organic fluctuations of mood and emotion."
"Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is"
"partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had"
"brought with them as provisions from Mars. These creatures, to judge"
"from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were"
"bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the"
"silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet high"
"and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets. Two or"
"three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and all were"
"killed before earth was reached. It was just as well for them, for the"
"mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every"
"bone in their bodies."
"And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place"
"certain further details which, although they were not all evident to us"
"at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to"
"form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures."
"In three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours."
"Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man sleeps."
"Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate, that"
"periodical extinction was unknown to them. They had little or no sense"
"of fatigue, it would seem. On earth they could never have moved without"
"effort, yet even to the last they kept in action. In twenty-four hours"
"they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth is perhaps the"
"case with the ants."
"In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the"
"Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the"
"tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men. A young"
"Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth during"
"the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially _budded_"
"off, just as young lilybulbs bud off, or like the young animals in the"
"fresh-water polyp."
"In man, in all the higher terrestrial animals, such a method of"
"increase has disappeared; but even on this earth it was certainly the"
"primitive method. Among the lower animals, up even to those first"
"cousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes"
"occur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its"
"competitor altogether. On Mars, however, just the reverse has"
"apparently been the case."
"It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of"
"quasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did"
"forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian"
"condition. His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or December,"
"1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_, and I"
"recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called _Punch_."
"He pointed out—writing in a foolish, facetious tone—that the perfection"
"of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the"
"perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as hair,"
"external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential parts of"
"the human being, and that the tendency of natural selection would lie"
"in the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages."
"The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity. Only one other part of"
"the body had a strong case for survival, and that was the hand,"
"“teacher and agent of the brain.” While the rest of the body dwindled,"
"the hands would grow larger."
"There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians we"
"have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of"
"the animal side of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quite"
"credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike"
"ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter"
"giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the"
"expense of the rest of the body. Without the body the brain would, of"
"course, become a mere selfish intelligence, without any of the"
"emotional substratum of the human being."
"The last salient point in which the systems of these creatures differed"
"from ours was in what one might have thought a very trivial particular."
"Micro-organisms, which cause so much disease and pain on earth, have"
"either never appeared upon Mars or Martian sanitary science eliminated"
"them ages ago. A hundred diseases, all the fevers and contagions of"
"human life, consumption, cancers, tumours and such morbidities, never"
"enter the scheme of their life. And speaking of the differences between"
"the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may allude here to the curious"
"suggestions of the red weed."
"Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a"
"dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds"
"which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them"
"gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known"
"popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition"
"with terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth,"
"and few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red weed"
"grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides of"
"the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its"
"cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our"
"triangular window. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the"
"country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water."
"The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single"
"round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range"
"not very different from ours except that, according to Philips, blue"
"and violet were as black to them. It is commonly supposed that they"
"communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted,"
"for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written"
"evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which I"
"have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief source of"
"information concerning them. Now no surviving human being saw so much"
"of the Martians in action as I did. I take no credit to myself for an"
"accident, but the fact is so. And I assert that I watched them closely"
"time after time, and that I have seen four, five, and (once) six of"
"them sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations"
"together without either sound or gesture. Their peculiar hooting"
"invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation, and was, I believe,"
"in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory to"
"the suctional operation. I have a certain claim to at least an"
"elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I am"
"convinced—as firmly as I am convinced of anything—that the Martians"
"interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation. And I have"
"been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before the"
"Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember, I"
"had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory."
"The Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of ornament and"
"decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they"
"evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but"
"changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all"
"seriously. Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other"
"artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great"
"superiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,"
"our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are"
"just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked"
"out. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodies"
"according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a"
"bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances,"
"perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that"
"what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism"
"is absent—the _wheel_ is absent; among all the things they brought to"
"earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels. One would"
"have at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it is"
"curious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the"
"wheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And not"
"only did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), or"
"abstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little use"
"is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circular"
"motions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of the"
"machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over"
"small but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon this"
"matter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their"
"machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of"
"the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn"
"closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of"
"electricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions,"
"which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was"
"attained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine"
"which, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking the"
"cylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians"
"lying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual"
"tentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space."
"While I was still watching their sluggish motions in the sunlight, and"
"noting each strange detail of their form, the curate reminded me of his"
"presence by pulling violently at my arm. I turned to a scowling face,"
"and silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only one"
"of us to peep through; and so I had to forego watching them for a time"
"while he enjoyed that privilege."
"When I looked again, the busy handling-machine had already put together"
"several of the pieces of apparatus it had taken out of the cylinder"
"into a shape having an unmistakable likeness to its own; and down on"
"the left a busy little digging mechanism had come into view, emitting"
"jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating and"
"embanking in a methodical and discriminating manner. This it was which"
"had caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks that had"
"kept our ruinous refuge quivering. It piped and whistled as it worked."
"So far as I could see, the thing was without a directing Martian at"
"all."
"III."
"THE DAYS OF IMPRISONMENT."
"The arrival of a second fighting-machine drove us from our peephole"
"into the scullery, for we feared that from his elevation the Martian"
"might see down upon us behind our barrier. At a later date we began to"
"feel less in danger of their eyes, for to an eye in the dazzle of the"
"sunlight outside our refuge must have been blank blackness, but at"
"first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery"
"in heart-throbbing retreat. Yet terrible as was the danger we incurred,"
"the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible. And I recall"
"now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite danger in"
"which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death, we"
"could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight. We"
"would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and"
"the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and thrust and"
"kick, within a few inches of exposure."
"The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits"
"of thought and action, and our danger and isolation only accentuated"
"the incompatibility. At Halliford I had already come to hate the"
"curate’s trick of helpless exclamation, his stupid rigidity of mind."
"His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think"
"out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and"
"intensified, almost to the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in"
"restraint as a silly woman. He would weep for hours together, and I"
"verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought"
"his weak tears in some way efficacious. And I would sit in the darkness"
"unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities. He ate"
"more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance"
"of life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their"
"pit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we"
"should need food. He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long"
"intervals. He slept little."
"As the days wore on, his utter carelessness of any consideration so"
"intensified our distress and danger that I had, much as I loathed doing"
"it, to resort to threats, and at last to blows. That brought him to"
"reason for a time. But he was one of those weak creatures, void of"
"pride, timorous, anæmic, hateful souls, full of shifty cunning, who"
"face neither God nor man, who face not even themselves."
"It is disagreeable for me to recall and write these things, but I set"
"them down that my story may lack nothing. Those who have escaped the"
"dark and terrible aspects of life will find my brutality, my flash of"
"rage in our final tragedy, easy enough to blame; for they know what is"
"wrong as well as any, but not what is possible to tortured men. But"
"those who have been under the shadow, who have gone down at last to"
"elemental things, will have a wider charity."
"And while within we fought out our dark, dim contest of whispers,"
"snatched food and drink, and gripping hands and blows, without, in the"
"pitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the"
"unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit. Let me return to those"
"first new experiences of mine. After a long time I ventured back to the"
"peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the"
"occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines. These last"
"had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly"
"manner about the cylinder. The second handling-machine was now"
"completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the"
"big machine had brought. This was a body resembling a milk can in its"
"general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from"
"which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below."
"The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the"
"handling-machine. With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was"
"digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle"
"above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed"
"rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine."
"Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a"
"ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the"
"mound of bluish dust. From this unseen receiver a little thread of"
"green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air. As I looked, the"
"handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,"
"telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere"
"blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay. In"
"another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,"
"untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a"
"growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit. Between sunset"
"and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred"
"such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust rose"
"steadily until it topped the side of the pit."
"The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these"
"contrivances and the inert panting clumsiness of their masters was"
"acute, and for days I had to tell myself repeatedly that these latter"
"were indeed the living of the two things."
"The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought"
"to the pit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with all my"
"ears. He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that we were"
"observed, crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the"
"rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,"
"gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. His gesture"
"suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my"
"curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and"
"clambered up to it. At first I could see no reason for his frantic"
"behaviour. The twilight had now come, the stars were little and faint,"
"but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from"
"the aluminium-making. The whole picture was a flickering scheme of"
"green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely trying to the"
"eyes. Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it not at all. The"
"sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound of blue-green"
"powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine, with"
"its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner"
"of the pit. And then, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a"
"drifting suspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only to"
"dismiss."
"I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying myself"
"now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian. As"
"the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument"
"and the brightness of his eyes. And suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a"
"long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little"
"cage that hunched upon its back. Then something—something struggling"
"violently—was lifted high against the sky, a black, vague enigma"
"against the starlight; and as this black object came down again, I saw"
"by the green brightness that it was a man. For an instant he was"
"clearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed;"
"three days before, he must have been walking the world, a man of"
"considerable consequence. I could see his staring eyes and gleams of"
"light on his studs and watch chain. He vanished behind the mound, and"
"for a moment there was silence. And then began a shrieking and a"
"sustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians."
"I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands over my"
"ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching"
"silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed, cried out"
"quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me."
"That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our horror"
"and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt an"
"urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape;"
"but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider our"
"position with great clearness. The curate, I found, was quite incapable"
"of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all"
"vestiges of reason or forethought. Practically he had already sunk to"
"the level of an animal. But as the saying goes, I gripped myself with"
"both hands. It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts, that"
"terrible as our position was, there was as yet no justification for"
"absolute despair. Our chief chance lay in the possibility of the"
"Martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment. Or"
"even if they kept it permanently, they might not consider it necessary"
"to guard it, and a chance of escape might be afforded us. I also"
"weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a"
"direction away from the pit, but the chances of our emerging within"
"sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great. And"
"I should have had to do all the digging myself. The curate would"
"certainly have failed me."
"It was on the third day, if my memory serves me right, that I saw the"
"lad killed. It was the only occasion on which I actually saw the"
"Martians feed. After that experience I avoided the hole in the wall for"
"the better part of a day. I went into the scullery, removed the door,"
"and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible;"
"but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth"
"collapsed noisily, and I did not dare continue. I lost heart, and lay"
"down on the scullery floor for a long time, having no spirit even to"
"move. And after that I abandoned altogether the idea of escaping by"
"excavation."
"It says much for the impression the Martians had made upon me that at"
"first I entertained little or no hope of our escape being brought about"
"by their overthrow through any human effort. But on the fourth or fifth"
"night I heard a sound like heavy guns."
"It was very late in the night, and the moon was shining brightly. The"
"Martians had taken away the excavating-machine, and, save for a"
"fighting-machine that stood in the remoter bank of the pit and a"
"handling-machine that was buried out of my sight in a corner of the pit"
"immediately beneath my peephole, the place was deserted by them. Except"
"for the pale glow from the handling-machine and the bars and patches of"
"white moonlight the pit was in darkness, and, except for the clinking"
"of the handling-machine, quite still. That night was a beautiful"
"serenity; save for one planet, the moon seemed to have the sky to"
"herself. I heard a dog howling, and that familiar sound it was that"
"made me listen. Then I heard quite distinctly a booming exactly like"
"the sound of great guns. Six distinct reports I counted, and after a"
"long interval six again. And that was all."
"IV."
"THE DEATH OF THE CURATE."
"It was on the sixth day of our imprisonment that I peeped for the last"
"time, and presently found myself alone. Instead of keeping close to me"
"and trying to oust me from the slit, the curate had gone back into the"
"scullery. I was struck by a sudden thought. I went back quickly and"
"quietly into the scullery. In the darkness I heard the curate drinking."
"I snatched in the darkness, and my fingers caught a bottle of burgundy."
"For a few minutes there was a tussle. The bottle struck the floor and"
"broke, and I desisted and rose. We stood panting and threatening each"
"other. In the end I planted myself between him and the food, and told"
"him of my determination to begin a discipline. I divided the food in"
"the pantry, into rations to last us ten days. I would not let him eat"
"any more that day. In the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at"
"the food. I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake. All day and"
"all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and he weeping and"
"complaining of his immediate hunger. It was, I know, a night and a day,"
"but to me it seemed—it seems now—an interminable length of time."
"And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict. For"
"two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests. There"
"were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I cajoled and"
"persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of"
"burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could get water."
"But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason. He"
"would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy"
"babbling to himself. The rudimentary precautions to keep our"
"imprisonment endurable he would not observe. Slowly I began to realise"
"the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole"
"companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane."
"From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind wandered"
"at times. I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept. It sounds"
"paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity"
"of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane man."
"On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and"
"nothing I could do would moderate his speech."
"“It is just, O God!” he would say, over and over again. “It is just. On"
"me and mine be the punishment laid. We have sinned, we have fallen"
"short. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust,"
"and I held my peace. I preached acceptable folly—my God, what"
"folly!—when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and called"
"upon them to repent—repent! . . . Oppressors of the poor and needy . ."
". ! The wine press of God!”"
"Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld from"
"him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening. He began to raise"
"his voice—I prayed him not to. He perceived a hold on me—he threatened"
"he would shout and bring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared"
"me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond"
"estimating. I defied him, although I felt no assurance that he might"
"not do this thing. But that day, at any rate, he did not. He talked"
"with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part of the eighth"
"and ninth days—threats, entreaties, mingled with a torrent of half-sane"
"and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God’s service, such"
"as made me pity him. Then he slept awhile, and began again with renewed"
"strength, so loudly that I must needs make him desist."
"“Be still!” I implored."
"He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near the"
"copper."
"“I have been still too long,” he said, in a tone that must have reached"
"the pit, “and now I must bear my witness. Woe unto this unfaithful"
"city! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! To the inhabitants of the earth by"
"reason of the other voices of the trumpet——”"
"“Shut up!” I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the Martians"
"should hear us. “For God’s sake——”"
"“Nay,” shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing likewise"
"and extending his arms. “Speak! The word of the Lord is upon me!”"
"In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen."
"“I must bear my witness! I go! It has already been too long delayed.”"
"I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall. In a"
"flash I was after him. I was fierce with fear. Before he was halfway"
"across the kitchen I had overtaken him. With one last touch of humanity"
"I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt. He went headlong"
"forward and lay stretched on the ground. I stumbled over him and stood"
"panting. He lay still."
"Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping"
"plaster, and the triangular aperture in the wall was darkened. I looked"
"up and saw the lower surface of a handling-machine coming slowly across"
"the hole. One of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another"
"limb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams. I stood"
"petrified, staring. Then I saw through a sort of glass plate near the"
"edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large dark eyes"
"of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came"
"feeling slowly through the hole."
"I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the"
"scullery door. The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in the"
"room, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this way"
"and that. For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance."
"Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery. I"
"trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright. I opened the door"
"of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness staring at the"
"faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening. Had the Martian"
"seen me? What was it doing now?"
"Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and then"
"it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a faint"
"metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring. Then a"
"heavy body—I knew too well what—was dragged across the floor of the"
"kitchen towards the opening. Irresistibly attracted, I crept to the"
"door and peeped into the kitchen. In the triangle of bright outer"
"sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,"
"scrutinizing the curate’s head. I thought at once that it would infer"
"my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him."
"I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover"
"myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the"
"darkness, among the firewood and coal therein. Every now and then I"
"paused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through"
"the opening again."
"Then the faint metallic jingle returned. I traced it slowly feeling"
"over the kitchen. Presently I heard it nearer—in the scullery, as I"
"judged. I thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me. I"
"prayed copiously. It passed, scraping faintly across the cellar door."
"An age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then I heard it"
"fumbling at the latch! It had found the door! The Martians understood"
"doors!"
"It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door"
"opened."
"In the darkness I could just see the thing—like an elephant’s trunk"
"more than anything else—waving towards me and touching and examining"
"the wall, coals, wood and ceiling. It was like a black worm swaying its"
"blind head to and fro."
"Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot. I was on the verge of"
"screaming; I bit my hand. For a time the tentacle was silent. I could"
"have fancied it had been withdrawn. Presently, with an abrupt click, it"
"gripped something—I thought it had me!—and seemed to go out of the"
"cellar again. For a minute I was not sure. Apparently it had taken a"
"lump of coal to examine."
"I seized the opportunity of slightly shifting my position, which had"
"become cramped, and then listened. I whispered passionate prayers for"
"safety."
"Then I heard the slow, deliberate sound creeping towards me again."
"Slowly, slowly it drew near, scratching against the walls and tapping"
"the furniture."
"While I was still doubtful, it rapped smartly against the cellar door"
"and closed it. I heard it go into the pantry, and the biscuit-tins"
"rattled and a bottle smashed, and then came a heavy bump against the"
"cellar door. Then silence that passed into an infinity of suspense."
"Had it gone?"
"At last I decided that it had."
"It came into the scullery no more; but I lay all the tenth day in the"
"close darkness, buried among coals and firewood, not daring even to"
"crawl out for the drink for which I craved. It was the eleventh day"
"before I ventured so far from my security."
"V."
"THE STILLNESS."
"My first act before I went into the pantry was to fasten the door"
"between the kitchen and the scullery. But the pantry was empty; every"
"scrap of food had gone. Apparently, the Martian had taken it all on the"
"previous day. At that discovery I despaired for the first time. I took"
"no food, or no drink either, on the eleventh or the twelfth day."
"At first my mouth and throat were parched, and my strength ebbed"
"sensibly. I sat about in the darkness of the scullery, in a state of"
"despondent wretchedness. My mind ran on eating. I thought I had become"
"deaf, for the noises of movement I had been accustomed to hear from the"
"pit had ceased absolutely. I did not feel strong enough to crawl"
"noiselessly to the peephole, or I would have gone there."
"On the twelfth day my throat was so painful that, taking the chance of"
"alarming the Martians, I attacked the creaking rain-water pump that"
"stood by the sink, and got a couple of glassfuls of blackened and"
"tainted rain water. I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened by"
"the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping."
"During these days, in a rambling, inconclusive way, I thought much of"
"the curate and of the manner of his death."
"On the thirteenth day I drank some more water, and dozed and thought"
"disjointedly of eating and of vague impossible plans of escape."
"Whenever I dozed I dreamt of horrible phantasms, of the death of the"
"curate, or of sumptuous dinners; but, asleep or awake, I felt a keen"
"pain that urged me to drink again and again. The light that came into"
"the scullery was no longer grey, but red. To my disordered imagination"
"it seemed the colour of blood."
"On the fourteenth day I went into the kitchen, and I was surprised to"
"find that the fronds of the red weed had grown right across the hole in"
"the wall, turning the half-light of the place into a crimson-coloured"
"obscurity."
"It was early on the fifteenth day that I heard a curious, familiar"
"sequence of sounds in the kitchen, and, listening, identified it as the"
"snuffing and scratching of a dog. Going into the kitchen, I saw a dog’s"
"nose peering in through a break among the ruddy fronds. This greatly"
"surprised me. At the scent of me he barked shortly."
"I thought if I could induce him to come into the place quietly I should"
"be able, perhaps, to kill and eat him; and in any case, it would be"
"advisable to kill him, lest his actions attracted the attention of the"
"Martians."
"I crept forward, saying “Good dog!” very softly; but he suddenly"
"withdrew his head and disappeared."
"I listened—I was not deaf—but certainly the pit was still. I heard a"
"sound like the flutter of a bird’s wings, and a hoarse croaking, but"
"that was all."
"For a long while I lay close to the peephole, but not daring to move"
"aside the red plants that obscured it. Once or twice I heard a faint"
"pitter-patter like the feet of the dog going hither and thither on the"
"sand far below me, and there were more birdlike sounds, but that was"
"all. At length, encouraged by the silence, I looked out."
"Except in the corner, where a multitude of crows hopped and fought over"
"the skeletons of the dead the Martians had consumed, there was not a"
"living thing in the pit."
"I stared about me, scarcely believing my eyes. All the machinery had"
"gone. Save for the big mound of greyish-blue powder in one corner,"
"certain bars of aluminium in another, the black birds, and the"
"skeletons of the killed, the place was merely an empty circular pit in"
"the sand."
"Slowly I thrust myself out through the red weed, and stood upon the"
"mound of rubble. I could see in any direction save behind me, to the"
"north, and neither Martians nor sign of Martians were to be seen. The"
"pit dropped sheerly from my feet, but a little way along the rubbish"
"afforded a practicable slope to the summit of the ruins. My chance of"
"escape had come. I began to tremble."
"I hesitated for some time, and then, in a gust of desperate resolution,"
"and with a heart that throbbed violently, I scrambled to the top of the"
"mound in which I had been buried so long."
"I looked about again. To the northward, too, no Martian was visible."
"When I had last seen this part of Sheen in the daylight it had been a"
"straggling street of comfortable white and red houses, interspersed"
"with abundant shady trees. Now I stood on a mound of smashed brickwork,"
"clay, and gravel, over which spread a multitude of red cactus-shaped"
"plants, knee-high, without a solitary terrestrial growth to dispute"
"their footing. The trees near me were dead and brown, but further a"
"network of red thread scaled the still living stems."
"The neighbouring houses had all been wrecked, but none had been burned;"
"their walls stood, sometimes to the second story, with smashed windows"
"and shattered doors. The red weed grew tumultuously in their roofless"
"rooms. Below me was the great pit, with the crows struggling for its"
"refuse. A number of other birds hopped about among the ruins. Far away"
"I saw a gaunt cat slink crouchingly along a wall, but traces of men"
"there were none."
"The day seemed, by contrast with my recent confinement, dazzlingly"
"bright, the sky a glowing blue. A gentle breeze kept the red weed that"
"covered every scrap of unoccupied ground gently swaying. And oh! the"
"sweetness of the air!"
"VI."
"THE WORK OF FIFTEEN DAYS."
"For some time I stood tottering on the mound regardless of my safety."
"Within that noisome den from which I had emerged I had thought with a"
"narrow intensity only of our immediate security. I had not realised"
"what had been happening to the world, had not anticipated this"
"startling vision of unfamiliar things. I had expected to see Sheen in"
"ruins—I found about me the landscape, weird and lurid, of another"
"planet."
"For that moment I touched an emotion beyond the common range of men,"
"yet one that the poor brutes we dominate know only too well. I felt as"
"a rabbit might feel returning to his burrow and suddenly confronted by"
"the work of a dozen busy navvies digging the foundations of a house. I"
"felt the first inkling of a thing that presently grew quite clear in my"
"mind, that oppressed me for many days, a sense of dethronement, a"
"persuasion that I was no longer a master, but an animal among the"
"animals, under the Martian heel. With us it would be as with them, to"
"lurk and watch, to run and hide; the fear and empire of man had passed"
"away."
"But so soon as this strangeness had been realised it passed, and my"
"dominant motive became the hunger of my long and dismal fast. In the"
"direction away from the pit I saw, beyond a red-covered wall, a patch"
"of garden ground unburied. This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,"
"and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed. The density of the weed gave"
"me a reassuring sense of hiding. The wall was some six feet high, and"
"when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the"
"crest. So I went along by the side of it, and came to a corner and a"
"rockwork that enabled me to get to the top, and tumble into the garden"
"I coveted. Here I found some young onions, a couple of gladiolus bulbs,"
"and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I secured, and,"
"scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through scarlet and"
"crimson trees towards Kew—it was like walking through an avenue of"
"gigantic blood drops—possessed with two ideas: to get more food, and to"
"limp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of this accursed"
"unearthly region of the pit."
"Some way farther, in a grassy place, was a group of mushrooms which"
"also I devoured, and then I came upon a brown sheet of flowing shallow"
"water, where meadows used to be. These fragments of nourishment served"
"only to whet my hunger. At first I was surprised at this flood in a"
"hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the"
"tropical exuberance of the red weed. Directly this extraordinary growth"
"encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled"
"fecundity. Its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the Wey"
"and Thames, and its swiftly growing and Titanic water fronds speedily"
"choked both those rivers."
"At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a tangle"
"of this weed, and at Richmond, too, the Thames water poured in a broad"
"and shallow stream across the meadows of Hampton and Twickenham. As the"
"water spread the weed followed them, until the ruined villas of the"
"Thames valley were for a time lost in this red swamp, whose margin I"
"explored, and much of the desolation the Martians had caused was"
"concealed."
"In the end the red weed succumbed almost as quickly as it had spread. A"
"cankering disease, due, it is believed, to the action of certain"
"bacteria, presently seized upon it. Now by the action of natural"
"selection, all terrestrial plants have acquired a resisting power"
"against bacterial diseases—they never succumb without a severe"
"struggle, but the red weed rotted like a thing already dead. The fronds"
"became bleached, and then shrivelled and brittle. They broke off at the"
"least touch, and the waters that had stimulated their early growth"
"carried their last vestiges out to sea."
"My first act on coming to this water was, of course, to slake my"
"thirst. I drank a great deal of it and, moved by an impulse, gnawed"
"some fronds of red weed; but they were watery, and had a sickly,"
"metallic taste. I found the water was sufficiently shallow for me to"
"wade securely, although the red weed impeded my feet a little; but the"
"flood evidently got deeper towards the river, and I turned back to"
"Mortlake. I managed to make out the road by means of occasional ruins"
"of its villas and fences and lamps, and so presently I got out of this"
"spate and made my way to the hill going up towards Roehampton and came"
"out on Putney Common."
"Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the"
"wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation"
"of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly"
"undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors"
"closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if"
"their inhabitants slept within. The red weed was less abundant; the"
"tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper. I hunted for"
"food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of"
"silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked. I"
"rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in my"
"enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on."
"All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians. I"
"encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried"
"circuitously away from the advances I made them. Near Roehampton I had"
"seen two human skeletons—not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean—and in"
"the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats"
"and rabbits and the skull of a sheep. But though I gnawed parts of"
"these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from them."
"After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I"
"think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason. And in the"
"garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,"
"sufficient to stay my hunger. From this garden one looked down upon"
"Putney and the river. The aspect of the place in the dusk was"
"singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and"
"down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the"
"weed. And over all—silence. It filled me with indescribable terror to"
"think how swiftly that desolating change had come."
"For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence, and"
"that I stood there alone, the last man left alive. Hard by the top of"
"Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms dislocated and"
"removed several yards from the rest of the body. As I proceeded I"
"became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was,"
"save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished in this part"
"of the world. The Martians, I thought, had gone on and left the country"
"desolated, seeking food elsewhere. Perhaps even now they were"
"destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone northward."
"VII."
"THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL."
"I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill,"
"sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to"
"Leatherhead. I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into"
"that house—afterwards I found the front door was on the latch—nor how I"
"ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of despair, in"
"what seemed to me to be a servant’s bedroom, I found a rat-gnawed crust"
"and two tins of pineapple. The place had been already searched and"
"emptied. In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches"
"that had been overlooked. The latter I could not eat, they were too"
"rotten, but the former not only stayed my hunger, but filled my"
"pockets. I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating that"
"part of London for food in the night. Before I went to bed I had an"
"interval of restlessness, and prowled from window to window, peering"
"out for some sign of these monsters. I slept little. As I lay in bed I"
"found myself thinking consecutively—a thing I do not remember to have"
"done since my last argument with the curate. During all the intervening"
"time my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague"
"emotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity. But in the night my"
"brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the food I had eaten, grew clear"
"again, and I thought."
"Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the"
"curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of my"
"wife. The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; I"
"saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely disagreeable but"
"quite without the quality of remorse. I saw myself then as I see myself"
"now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow, the creature of a"
"sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that. I felt no"
"condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted me. In the"
"silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of God that"
"sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial,"
"my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear. I retraced every step"
"of our conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching"
"beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke"
"that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge. We had been incapable of"
"co-operation—grim chance had taken no heed of that. Had I foreseen, I"
"should have left him at Halliford. But I did not foresee; and crime is"
"to foresee and do. And I set this down as I have set all this story"
"down, as it was. There were no witnesses—all these things I might have"
"concealed. But I set it down, and the reader must form his judgment as"
"he will."
"And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate"
"body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife. For"
"the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,"
"unhappily, I could for the latter. And suddenly that night became"
"terrible. I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark. I"
"found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and"
"painlessly struck her out of being. Since the night of my return from"
"Leatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,"
"had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I"
"prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the"
"darkness of God. Strange night! Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn"
"had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house like a rat"
"leaving its hiding place—a creature scarcely larger, an inferior"
"animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be"
"hunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confidently to God. Surely,"
"if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us pity—pity for"
"those witless souls that suffer our dominion."
"The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink, and"
"was fretted with little golden clouds. In the road that runs from the"
"top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the"
"panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night"
"after the fighting began. There was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed"
"with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with a smashed"
"wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into"
"the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot of"
"blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough. My movements"
"were languid, my plans of the vaguest. I had an idea of going to"
"Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest chance of"
"finding my wife. Certainly, unless death had overtaken them suddenly,"
"my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me I might"
"find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled. I knew I wanted"
"to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the world of men, but"
"I had no clear idea how the finding might be done. I was also sharply"
"aware now of my intense loneliness. From the corner I went, under cover"
"of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common,"
"stretching wide and far."
"That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there"
"was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge"
"of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality. I"
"came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the"
"trees. I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout"
"resolve to live. And presently, turning suddenly, with an odd feeling"
"of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes."
"I stood regarding this. I made a step towards it, and it rose up and"
"became a man armed with a cutlass. I approached him slowly. He stood"
"silent and motionless, regarding me."
"As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and"
"filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged"
"through a culvert. Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches"
"mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches. His"
"black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and"
"sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him. There was a red cut"
"across the lower part of his face."
"“Stop!” he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I stopped."
"His voice was hoarse. “Where do you come from?” he said."
"I thought, surveying him."
"“I come from Mortlake,” I said. “I was buried near the pit the Martians"
"made about their cylinder. I have worked my way out and escaped.”"
"“There is no food about here,” he said. “This is my country. All this"
"hill down to the river, and back to Clapham, and up to the edge of the"
"common. There is only food for one. Which way are you going?”"
"I answered slowly."
"“I don’t know,” I said. “I have been buried in the ruins of a house"
"thirteen or fourteen days. I don’t know what has happened.”"
"He looked at me doubtfully, then started, and looked with a changed"
"expression."
"“I’ve no wish to stop about here,” said I. “I think I shall go to"
"Leatherhead, for my wife was there.”"
"He shot out a pointing finger."
"“It is you,” said he; “the man from Woking. And you weren’t killed at"
"Weybridge?”"
"I recognised him at the same moment."
"“You are the artilleryman who came into my garden.”"
"“Good luck!” he said. “We are lucky ones! Fancy _you_!” He put out a"
"hand, and I took it. “I crawled up a drain,” he said. “But they didn’t"
"kill everyone. And after they went away I got off towards Walton across"
"the fields. But—— It’s not sixteen days altogether—and your hair is"
"grey.” He looked over his shoulder suddenly. “Only a rook,” he said."
"“One gets to know that birds have shadows these days. This is a bit"
"open. Let us crawl under those bushes and talk.”"
"“Have you seen any Martians?” I said. “Since I crawled out——”"
"“They’ve gone away across London,” he said. “I guess they’ve got a"
"bigger camp there. Of a night, all over there, Hampstead way, the sky"
"is alive with their lights. It’s like a great city, and in the glare"
"you can just see them moving. By daylight you can’t. But nearer—I"
"haven’t seen them—” (he counted on his fingers) “five days. Then I saw"
"a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big. And the night"
"before last”—he stopped and spoke impressively—“it was just a matter of"
"lights, but it was something up in the air. I believe they’ve built a"
"flying-machine, and are learning to fly.”"
"I stopped, on hands and knees, for we had come to the bushes."
"“Fly!”"
"“Yes,” he said, “fly.”"
"I went on into a little bower, and sat down."
"“It is all over with humanity,” I said. “If they can do that they will"
"simply go round the world.”"
"He nodded."
"“They will. But—— It will relieve things over here a bit. And"
"besides——” He looked at me. “Aren’t you satisfied it _is_ up with"
"humanity? I am. We’re down; we’re beat.”"
"I stared. Strange as it may seem, I had not arrived at this fact—a fact"
"perfectly obvious so soon as he spoke. I had still held a vague hope;"
"rather, I had kept a lifelong habit of mind. He repeated his words,"
"“We’re beat.” They carried absolute conviction."
"“It’s all over,” he said. “They’ve lost _one_—just _one_. And they’ve"
"made their footing good and crippled the greatest power in the world."
"They’ve walked over us. The death of that one at Weybridge was an"
"accident. And these are only pioneers. They kept on coming. These green"
"stars—I’ve seen none these five or six days, but I’ve no doubt they’re"
"falling somewhere every night. Nothing’s to be done. We’re under! We’re"
"beat!”"
"I made him no answer. I sat staring before me, trying in vain to devise"
"some countervailing thought."
"“This isn’t a war,” said the artilleryman. “It never was a war, any"
"more than there’s war between man and ants.”"
"Suddenly I recalled the night in the observatory."
"“After the tenth shot they fired no more—at least, until the first"
"cylinder came.”"
"“How do you know?” said the artilleryman. I explained. He thought."
"“Something wrong with the gun,” he said. “But what if there is? They’ll"
"get it right again. And even if there’s a delay, how can it alter the"
"end? It’s just men and ants. There’s the ants builds their cities, live"
"their lives, have wars, revolutions, until the men want them out of the"
"way, and then they go out of the way. That’s what we are now—just ants."
"Only——”"
"“Yes,” I said."
"“We’re eatable ants.”"
"We sat looking at each other."
"“And what will they do with us?” I said."
"“That’s what I’ve been thinking,” he said; “that’s what I’ve been"
"thinking. After Weybridge I went south—thinking. I saw what was up."
"Most of the people were hard at it squealing and exciting themselves."
"But I’m not so fond of squealing. I’ve been in sight of death once or"
"twice; I’m not an ornamental soldier, and at the best and worst,"
"death—it’s just death. And it’s the man that keeps on thinking comes"
"through. I saw everyone tracking away south. Says I, ‘Food won’t last"
"this way,’ and I turned right back. I went for the Martians like a"
"sparrow goes for man. All round”—he waved a hand to the"
"horizon—“they’re starving in heaps, bolting, treading on each other. ."
". .”"
"He saw my face, and halted awkwardly."
"“No doubt lots who had money have gone away to France,” he said. He"
"seemed to hesitate whether to apologise, met my eyes, and went on:"
"“There’s food all about here. Canned things in shops; wines, spirits,"
"mineral waters; and the water mains and drains are empty. Well, I was"
"telling you what I was thinking. ‘Here’s intelligent things,’ I said,"
"‘and it seems they want us for food. First, they’ll smash us up—ships,"
"machines, guns, cities, all the order and organisation. All that will"
"go. If we were the size of ants we might pull through. But we’re not."
"It’s all too bulky to stop. That’s the first certainty.’ Eh?”"
"I assented."
"“It is; I’ve thought it out. Very well, then—next; at present we’re"
"caught as we’re wanted. A Martian has only to go a few miles to get a"
"crowd on the run. And I saw one, one day, out by Wandsworth, picking"
"houses to pieces and routing among the wreckage. But they won’t keep on"
"doing that. So soon as they’ve settled all our guns and ships, and"
"smashed our railways, and done all the things they are doing over"
"there, they will begin catching us systematic, picking the best and"
"storing us in cages and things. That’s what they will start doing in a"
"bit. Lord! They haven’t begun on us yet. Don’t you see that?”"
"“Not begun!” I exclaimed."
"“Not begun. All that’s happened so far is through our not having the"
"sense to keep quiet—worrying them with guns and such foolery. And"
"losing our heads, and rushing off in crowds to where there wasn’t any"
"more safety than where we were. They don’t want to bother us yet."
"They’re making their things—making all the things they couldn’t bring"
"with them, getting things ready for the rest of their people. Very"
"likely that’s why the cylinders have stopped for a bit, for fear of"
"hitting those who are here. And instead of our rushing about blind, on"
"the howl, or getting dynamite on the chance of busting them up, we’ve"
"got to fix ourselves up according to the new state of affairs. That’s"
"how I figure it out. It isn’t quite according to what a man wants for"
"his species, but it’s about what the facts point to. And that’s the"
"principle I acted upon. Cities, nations, civilisation, progress—it’s"
"all over. That game’s up. We’re beat.”"
"“But if that is so, what is there to live for?”"
"The artilleryman looked at me for a moment."
"“There won’t be any more blessed concerts for a million years or so;"
"there won’t be any Royal Academy of Arts, and no nice little feeds at"
"restaurants. If it’s amusement you’re after, I reckon the game is up."
"If you’ve got any drawing-room manners or a dislike to eating peas with"
"a knife or dropping aitches, you’d better chuck ’em away. They ain’t no"
"further use.”"
"“You mean——”"
"“I mean that men like me are going on living—for the sake of the breed."
"I tell you, I’m grim set on living. And if I’m not mistaken, you’ll"
"show what insides _you’ve_ got, too, before long. We aren’t going to be"
"exterminated. And I don’t mean to be caught either, and tamed and"
"fattened and bred like a thundering ox. Ugh! Fancy those brown"
"creepers!”"
"“You don’t mean to say——”"
"“I do. I’m going on, under their feet. I’ve got it planned; I’ve"
"thought it out. We men are beat. We don’t know enough. We’ve got to"
"learn before we’ve got a chance. And we’ve got to live and keep"
"independent while we learn. See! That’s what has to be done.”"
"I stared, astonished, and stirred profoundly by the man’s resolution."
"“Great God!” cried I. “But you are a man indeed!” And suddenly I"
"gripped his hand."
"“Eh!” he said, with his eyes shining. “I’ve thought it out, eh?”"
"“Go on,” I said."
"“Well, those who mean to escape their catching must get ready. I’m"
"getting ready. Mind you, it isn’t all of us that are made for wild"
"beasts; and that’s what it’s got to be. That’s why I watched you. I had"
"my doubts. You’re slender. I didn’t know that it was you, you see, or"
"just how you’d been buried. All these—the sort of people that lived in"
"these houses, and all those damn little clerks that used to live down"
"_that_ way—they’d be no good. They haven’t any spirit in them—no proud"
"dreams and no proud lusts; and a man who hasn’t one or the other—Lord!"
"What is he but funk and precautions? They just used to skedaddle off to"
"work—I’ve seen hundreds of ’em, bit of breakfast in hand, running wild"
"and shining to catch their little season-ticket train, for fear they’d"
"get dismissed if they didn’t; working at businesses they were afraid to"
"take the trouble to understand; skedaddling back for fear they wouldn’t"
"be in time for dinner; keeping indoors after dinner for fear of the"
"back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not because"
"they wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would make"
"for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world."
"Lives insured and a bit invested for fear of accidents. And on"
"Sundays—fear of the hereafter. As if hell was built for rabbits! Well,"
"the Martians will just be a godsend to these. Nice roomy cages,"
"fattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing"
"about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they’ll come and be"
"caught cheerful. They’ll be quite glad after a bit. They’ll wonder what"
"people did before there were Martians to take care of them. And the bar"
"loafers, and mashers, and singers—I can imagine them. I can imagine"
"them,” he said, with a sort of sombre gratification. “There’ll be any"
"amount of sentiment and religion loose among them. There’s hundreds of"
"things I saw with my eyes that I’ve only begun to see clearly these"
"last few days. There’s lots will take things as they are—fat and"
"stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it’s all"
"wrong, and that they ought to be doing something. Now whenever things"
"are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the"
"weak, and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always"
"make for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and"
"submit to persecution and the will of the Lord. Very likely you’ve seen"
"the same thing. It’s energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean inside"
"out. These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety. And those"
"of a less simple sort will work in a bit of—what is it?—eroticism.”"
"He paused."
"“Very likely these Martians will make pets of some of them; train them"
"to do tricks—who knows?—get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up"
"and had to be killed. And some, maybe, they will train to hunt us.”"
"“No,” I cried, “that’s impossible! No human being——”"
"“What’s the good of going on with such lies?” said the artilleryman."
"“There’s men who’d do it cheerful. What nonsense to pretend there"
"isn’t!”"
"And I succumbed to his conviction."
"“If they come after me,” he said; “Lord, if they come after me!” and"
"subsided into a grim meditation."
"I sat contemplating these things. I could find nothing to bring against"
"this man’s reasoning. In the days before the invasion no one would have"
"questioned my intellectual superiority to his—I, a professed and"
"recognised writer on philosophical themes, and he, a common soldier;"
"and yet he had already formulated a situation that I had scarcely"
"realised."
"“What are you doing?” I said presently. “What plans have you made?”"
"He hesitated."
"“Well, it’s like this,” he said. “What have we to do? We have to invent"
"a sort of life where men can live and breed, and be sufficiently secure"
"to bring the children up. Yes—wait a bit, and I’ll make it clearer what"
"I think ought to be done. The tame ones will go like all tame beasts;"
"in a few generations they’ll be big, beautiful, rich-blooded,"
"stupid—rubbish! The risk is that we who keep wild will go"
"savage—degenerate into a sort of big, savage rat. . . . You see, how I"
"mean to live is underground. I’ve been thinking about the drains. Of"
"course those who don’t know drains think horrible things; but under"
"this London are miles and miles—hundreds of miles—and a few days rain"
"and London empty will leave them sweet and clean. The main drains are"
"big enough and airy enough for anyone. Then there’s cellars, vaults,"
"stores, from which bolting passages may be made to the drains. And the"
"railway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin to see? And we form a"
"band—able-bodied, clean-minded men. We’re not going to pick up any"
"rubbish that drifts in. Weaklings go out again.”"
"“As you meant me to go?”"
"“Well—I parleyed, didn’t I?”"
"“We won’t quarrel about that. Go on.”"
"“Those who stop obey orders. Able-bodied, clean-minded women we want"
"also—mothers and teachers. No lackadaisical ladies—no blasted rolling"
"eyes. We can’t have any weak or silly. Life is real again, and the"
"useless and cumbersome and mischievous have to die. They ought to die."
"They ought to be willing to die. It’s a sort of disloyalty, after all,"
"to live and taint the race. And they can’t be happy. Moreover, dying’s"
"none so dreadful; it’s the funking makes it bad. And in all those"
"places we shall gather. Our district will be London. And we may even be"
"able to keep a watch, and run about in the open when the Martians keep"
"away. Play cricket, perhaps. That’s how we shall save the race. Eh?"
"It’s a possible thing? But saving the race is nothing in itself. As I"
"say, that’s only being rats. It’s saving our knowledge and adding to it"
"is the thing. There men like you come in. There’s books, there’s"
"models. We must make great safe places down deep, and get all the books"
"we can; not novels and poetry swipes, but ideas, science books. That’s"
"where men like you come in. We must go to the British Museum and pick"
"all those books through. Especially we must keep up our science—learn"
"more. We must watch these Martians. Some of us must go as spies. When"
"it’s all working, perhaps I will. Get caught, I mean. And the great"
"thing is, we must leave the Martians alone. We mustn’t even steal. If"
"we get in their way, we clear out. We must show them we mean no harm."
"Yes, I know. But they’re intelligent things, and they won’t hunt us"
"down if they have all they want, and think we’re just harmless vermin.”"
"The artilleryman paused and laid a brown hand upon my arm."
"“After all, it may not be so much we may have to learn before—Just"
"imagine this: four or five of their fighting machines suddenly starting"
"off—Heat-Rays right and left, and not a Martian in ’em. Not a Martian"
"in ’em, but men—men who have learned the way how. It may be in my time,"
"even—those men. Fancy having one of them lovely things, with its"
"Heat-Ray wide and free! Fancy having it in control! What would it"
"matter if you smashed to smithereens at the end of the run, after a"
"bust like that? I reckon the Martians’ll open their beautiful eyes!"
"Can’t you see them, man? Can’t you see them hurrying, hurrying—puffing"
"and blowing and hooting to their other mechanical affairs? Something"
"out of gear in every case. And swish, bang, rattle, swish! Just as they"
"are fumbling over it, _swish_ comes the Heat-Ray, and, behold! man has"
"come back to his own.”"
"For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the tone of"
"assurance and courage he assumed, completely dominated my mind. I"
"believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in"
"the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks"
"me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position, reading steadily"
"with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine, crouching fearfully"
"in the bushes and listening, distracted by apprehension. We talked in"
"this manner through the early morning time, and later crept out of the"
"bushes, and, after scanning the sky for Martians, hurried precipitately"
"to the house on Putney Hill where he had made his lair. It was the coal"
"cellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had spent a week"
"upon—it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which he designed to"
"reach to the main drain on Putney Hill—I had my first inkling of the"
"gulf between his dreams and his powers. Such a hole I could have dug in"
"a day. But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that"
"morning until past midday at his digging. We had a garden barrow and"
"shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range. We refreshed"
"ourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring"
"pantry. I found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the"
"world in this steady labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in"
"my mind, and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I"
"worked there all the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a"
"purpose again. After working an hour I began to speculate on the"
"distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached, the chances we"
"had of missing it altogether. My immediate trouble was why we should"
"dig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at"
"once down one of the manholes, and work back to the house. It seemed to"
"me, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a"
"needless length of tunnel. And just as I was beginning to face these"
"things, the artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me."
"“We’re working well,” he said. He put down his spade. “Let us knock off"
"a bit” he said. “I think it’s time we reconnoitred from the roof of the"
"house.”"
"I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade;"
"and then suddenly I was struck by a thought. I stopped, and so did he"
"at once."
"“Why were you walking about the common,” I said, “instead of being"
"here?”"
"“Taking the air,” he said. “I was coming back. It’s safer by night.”"
"“But the work?”"
"“Oh, one can’t always work,” he said, and in a flash I saw the man"
"plain. He hesitated, holding his spade. “We ought to reconnoitre now,”"
"he said, “because if any come near they may hear the spades and drop"
"upon us unawares.”"
"I was no longer disposed to object. We went together to the roof and"
"stood on a ladder peeping out of the roof door. No Martians were to be"
"seen, and we ventured out on the tiles, and slipped down under shelter"
"of the parapet."
"From this position a shrubbery hid the greater portion of Putney, but"
"we could see the river below, a bubbly mass of red weed, and the low"
"parts of Lambeth flooded and red. The red creeper swarmed up the trees"
"about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and dead, and"
"set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters. It was strange how"
"entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their"
"propagation. About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums, pink"
"mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurels and"
"hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight. Beyond Kensington"
"dense smoke was rising, and that and a blue haze hid the northward"
"hills."
"The artilleryman began to tell me of the sort of people who still"
"remained in London."
"“One night last week,” he said, “some fools got the electric light in"
"order, and there was all Regent Street and the Circus ablaze, crowded"
"with painted and ragged drunkards, men and women, dancing and shouting"
"till dawn. A man who was there told me. And as the day came they became"
"aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham and looking"
"down at them. Heaven knows how long he had been there. It must have"
"given some of them a nasty turn. He came down the road towards them,"
"and picked up nearly a hundred too drunk or frightened to run away.”"
"Grotesque gleam of a time no history will ever fully describe!"
"From that, in answer to my questions, he came round to his grandiose"
"plans again. He grew enthusiastic. He talked so eloquently of the"
"possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than half"
"believed in him again. But now that I was beginning to understand"
"something of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid on doing"
"nothing precipitately. And I noted that now there was no question that"
"he personally was to capture and fight the great machine."
"After a time we went down to the cellar. Neither of us seemed disposed"
"to resume digging, and when he suggested a meal, I was nothing loath."
"He became suddenly very generous, and when we had eaten he went away"
"and returned with some excellent cigars. We lit these, and his optimism"
"glowed. He was inclined to regard my coming as a great occasion."
"“There’s some champagne in the cellar,” he said."
"“We can dig better on this Thames-side burgundy,” said I."
"“No,” said he; “I am host today. Champagne! Great God! We’ve a heavy"
"enough task before us! Let us take a rest and gather strength while we"
"may. Look at these blistered hands!”"
"And pursuant to this idea of a holiday, he insisted upon playing cards"
"after we had eaten. He taught me euchre, and after dividing London"
"between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we played"
"for parish points. Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober"
"reader, it is absolutely true, and what is more remarkable, I found the"
"card game and several others we played extremely interesting."
"Strange mind of man! that, with our species upon the edge of"
"extermination or appalling degradation, with no clear prospect before"
"us but the chance of a horrible death, we could sit following the"
"chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the “joker” with vivid"
"delight. Afterwards he taught me poker, and I beat him at three tough"
"chess games. When dark came we decided to take the risk, and lit a"
"lamp."
"After an interminable string of games, we supped, and the artilleryman"
"finished the champagne. We went on smoking the cigars. He was no longer"
"the energetic regenerator of his species I had encountered in the"
"morning. He was still optimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more"
"thoughtful optimism. I remember he wound up with my health, proposed in"
"a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence. I took a"
"cigar, and went upstairs to look at the lights of which he had spoken"
"that blazed so greenly along the Highgate hills."
"At first I stared unintelligently across the London valley. The"
"northern hills were shrouded in darkness; the fires near Kensington"
"glowed redly, and now and then an orange-red tongue of flame flashed up"
"and vanished in the deep blue night. All the rest of London was black."
"Then, nearer, I perceived a strange light, a pale, violet-purple"
"fluorescent glow, quivering under the night breeze. For a space I could"
"not understand it, and then I knew that it must be the red weed from"
"which this faint irradiation proceeded. With that realisation my"
"dormant sense of wonder, my sense of the proportion of things, awoke"
"again. I glanced from that to Mars, red and clear, glowing high in the"
"west, and then gazed long and earnestly at the darkness of Hampstead"
"and Highgate."
"I remained a very long time upon the roof, wondering at the grotesque"
"changes of the day. I recalled my mental states from the midnight"
"prayer to the foolish card-playing. I had a violent revulsion of"
"feeling. I remember I flung away the cigar with a certain wasteful"
"symbolism. My folly came to me with glaring exaggeration. I seemed a"
"traitor to my wife and to my kind; I was filled with remorse. I"
"resolved to leave this strange undisciplined dreamer of great things to"
"his drink and gluttony, and to go on into London. There, it seemed to"
"me, I had the best chance of learning what the Martians and my"
"fellowmen were doing. I was still upon the roof when the late moon"
"rose."
"VIII."
"DEAD LONDON."
"After I had parted from the artilleryman, I went down the hill, and by"
"the High Street across the bridge to Fulham. The red weed was"
"tumultuous at that time, and nearly choked the bridge roadway; but its"
"fronds were already whitened in patches by the spreading disease that"
"presently removed it so swiftly."
"At the corner of the lane that runs to Putney Bridge station I found a"
"man lying. He was as black as a sweep with the black dust, alive, but"
"helplessly and speechlessly drunk. I could get nothing from him but"
"curses and furious lunges at my head. I think I should have stayed by"
"him but for the brutal expression of his face."
"There was black dust along the roadway from the bridge onwards, and it"
"grew thicker in Fulham. The streets were horribly quiet. I got"
"food—sour, hard, and mouldy, but quite eatable—in a baker’s shop here."
"Some way towards Walham Green the streets became clear of powder, and I"
"passed a white terrace of houses on fire; the noise of the burning was"
"an absolute relief. Going on towards Brompton, the streets were quiet"
"again."
"Here I came once more upon the black powder in the streets and upon"
"dead bodies. I saw altogether about a dozen in the length of the Fulham"
"Road. They had been dead many days, so that I hurried quickly past"
"them. The black powder covered them over, and softened their outlines."
"One or two had been disturbed by dogs."
"Where there was no black powder, it was curiously like a Sunday in the"
"City, with the closed shops, the houses locked up and the blinds drawn,"
"the desertion, and the stillness. In some places plunderers had been at"
"work, but rarely at other than the provision and wine shops. A"
"jeweller’s window had been broken open in one place, but apparently the"
"thief had been disturbed, and a number of gold chains and a watch lay"
"scattered on the pavement. I did not trouble to touch them. Farther on"
"was a tattered woman in a heap on a doorstep; the hand that hung over"
"her knee was gashed and bled down her rusty brown dress, and a smashed"
"magnum of champagne formed a pool across the pavement. She seemed"
"asleep, but she was dead."
"The farther I penetrated into London, the profounder grew the"
"stillness. But it was not so much the stillness of death—it was the"
"stillness of suspense, of expectation. At any time the destruction that"
"had already singed the northwestern borders of the metropolis, and had"
"annihilated Ealing and Kilburn, might strike among these houses and"
"leave them smoking ruins. It was a city condemned and derelict. . . ."
"In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder."
"It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling. It crept"
"almost imperceptibly upon my senses. It was a sobbing alternation of"
"two notes, “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” keeping on perpetually. When I"
"passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume, and houses and"
"buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again. It came in a full tide"
"down Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens,"
"wondering at this strange, remote wailing. It was as if that mighty"
"desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude."
"“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” wailed that superhuman note—great waves of"
"sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall"
"buildings on each side. I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the"
"iron gates of Hyde Park. I had half a mind to break into the Natural"
"History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in"
"order to see across the park. But I decided to keep to the ground,"
"where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition Road."
"All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still,"
"and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses. At the top,"
"near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned, and"
"the skeleton of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time,"
"and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew"
"stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the housetops"
"on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to the northwest."
"“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me,"
"from the district about Regent’s Park. The desolating cry worked upon"
"my mind. The mood that had sustained me passed. The wailing took"
"possession of me. I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and now"
"again hungry and thirsty."
"It was already past noon. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the"
"dead? Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its"
"black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends"
"that I had forgotten for years. I thought of the poisons in the"
"chemists’ shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled"
"the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared the"
"city with myself. . . ."
"I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black"
"powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the gratings"
"of the cellars of some of the houses. I grew very thirsty after the"
"heat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to break into a"
"public-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating, and went"
"into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair sofa I"
"found there."
"I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, “Ulla, ulla,"
"ulla, ulla.” It was now dusk, and after I had routed out some biscuits"
"and a cheese in the bar—there was a meat safe, but it contained nothing"
"but maggots—I wandered on through the silent residential squares to"
"Baker Street—Portman Square is the only one I can name—and so came out"
"at last upon Regent’s Park. And as I emerged from the top of Baker"
"Street, I saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset"
"the hood of the Martian giant from which this howling proceeded. I was"
"not terrified. I came upon him as if it were a matter of course. I"
"watched him for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to be"
"standing and yelling, for no reason that I could discover."
"I tried to formulate a plan of action. That perpetual sound of “Ulla,"
"ulla, ulla, ulla,” confused my mind. Perhaps I was too tired to be very"
"fearful. Certainly I was more curious to know the reason of this"
"monotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away from the park and"
"struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went along under"
"the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this stationary, howling"
"Martian from the direction of St. John’s Wood. A couple of hundred"
"yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a"
"dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong"
"towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He"
"made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a"
"fresh competitor. As the yelping died away down the silent road, the"
"wailing sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” reasserted itself."
"I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John’s Wood"
"station. At first I thought a house had fallen across the road. It was"
"only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this"
"mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and"
"twisted, among the ruins it had made. The forepart was shattered. It"
"seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been"
"overwhelmed in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that this might have"
"happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its"
"Martian. I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the"
"twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was"
"smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had left,"
"were invisible to me."
"Wondering still more at all that I had seen, I pushed on towards"
"Primrose Hill. Far away, through a gap in the trees, I saw a second"
"Martian, as motionless as the first, standing in the park towards the"
"Zoological Gardens, and silent. A little beyond the ruins about the"
"smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the"
"Regent’s Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation."
"As I crossed the bridge, the sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” ceased."
"It was, as it were, cut off. The silence came like a thunderclap."
"The dusky houses about me stood faint and tall and dim; the trees"
"towards the park were growing black. All about me the red weed"
"clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness."
"Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me. But while"
"that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable; by"
"virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life about"
"me had upheld me. Then suddenly a change, the passing of something—I"
"knew not what—and then a stillness that could be felt. Nothing but this"
"gaunt quiet."
"London about me gazed at me spectrally. The windows in the white houses"
"were like the eye sockets of skulls. About me my imagination found a"
"thousand noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized me, a horror of my"
"temerity. In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was"
"tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway. I could"
"not bring myself to go on. I turned down St. John’s Wood Road, and ran"
"headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn. I hid from"
"the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a cabmen’s"
"shelter in Harrow Road. But before the dawn my courage returned, and"
"while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards"
"Regent’s Park. I missed my way among the streets, and presently saw"
"down a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn, the curve of"
"Primrose Hill. On the summit, towering up to the fading stars, was a"
"third Martian, erect and motionless like the others."
"An insane resolve possessed me. I would die and end it. And I would"
"save myself even the trouble of killing myself. I marched on recklessly"
"towards this Titan, and then, as I drew nearer and the light grew, I"
"saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about"
"the hood. At that my heart gave a bound, and I began running along the"
"road."
"I hurried through the red weed that choked St. Edmund’s Terrace (I"
"waded breast-high across a torrent of water that was rushing down from"
"the waterworks towards the Albert Road), and emerged upon the grass"
"before the rising of the sun. Great mounds had been heaped about the"
"crest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it—it was the final and"
"largest place the Martians had made—and from behind these heaps there"
"rose a thin smoke against the sky. Against the sky line an eager dog"
"ran and disappeared. The thought that had flashed into my mind grew"
"real, grew credible. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation,"
"as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster. Out of the hood"
"hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds pecked and tore."
"In another moment I had scrambled up the earthen rampart and stood upon"
"its crest, and the interior of the redoubt was below me. A mighty space"
"it was, with gigantic machines here and there within it, huge mounds of"
"material and strange shelter places. And scattered about it, some in"
"their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines,"
"and a dozen of them stark and silent and laid in a row, were the"
"Martians—_dead_!—slain by the putrefactive and disease bacteria against"
"which their systems were unprepared; slain as the red weed was being"
"slain; slain, after all man’s devices had failed, by the humblest"
"things that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this earth."
"For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen"
"had not terror and disaster blinded our minds. These germs of disease"
"have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things—taken toll of"
"our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this"
"natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no"
"germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many—those that cause"
"putrefaction in dead matter, for instance—our living frames are"
"altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly"
"these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic"
"allies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they"
"were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and"
"fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought"
"his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would"
"still be his were the Martians ten times as mighty as they are. For"
"neither do men live nor die in vain."
"Here and there they were scattered, nearly fifty altogether, in that"
"great gulf they had made, overtaken by a death that must have seemed to"
"them as incomprehensible as any death could be. To me also at that time"
"this death was incomprehensible. All I knew was that these things that"
"had been alive and so terrible to men were dead. For a moment I"
"believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that"
"God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night."
"I stood staring into the pit, and my heart lightened gloriously, even"
"as the rising sun struck the world to fire about me with his rays. The"
"pit was still in darkness; the mighty engines, so great and wonderful"
"in their power and complexity, so unearthly in their tortuous forms,"
"rose weird and vague and strange out of the shadows towards the light."
"A multitude of dogs, I could hear, fought over the bodies that lay"
"darkly in the depth of the pit, far below me. Across the pit on its"
"farther lip, flat and vast and strange, lay the great flying-machine"
"with which they had been experimenting upon our denser atmosphere when"
"decay and death arrested them. Death had come not a day too soon. At"
"the sound of a cawing overhead I looked up at the huge fighting-machine"
"that would fight no more for ever, at the tattered red shreds of flesh"
"that dripped down upon the overturned seats on the summit of Primrose"
"Hill."
"I turned and looked down the slope of the hill to where, enhaloed now"
"in birds, stood those other two Martians that I had seen overnight,"
"just as death had overtaken them. The one had died, even as it had been"
"crying to its companions; perhaps it was the last to die, and its voice"
"had gone on perpetually until the force of its machinery was exhausted."
"They glittered now, harmless tripod towers of shining metal, in the"
"brightness of the rising sun."
"All about the pit, and saved as by a miracle from everlasting"
"destruction, stretched the great Mother of Cities. Those who have only"
"seen London veiled in her sombre robes of smoke can scarcely imagine"
"the naked clearness and beauty of the silent wilderness of houses."
"Eastward, over the blackened ruins of the Albert Terrace and the"
"splintered spire of the church, the sun blazed dazzling in a clear sky,"
"and here and there some facet in the great wilderness of roofs caught"
"the light and glared with a white intensity."
"Northward were Kilburn and Hampsted, blue and crowded with houses;"
"westward the great city was dimmed; and southward, beyond the Martians,"
"the green waves of Regent’s Park, the Langham Hotel, the dome of the"
"Albert Hall, the Imperial Institute, and the giant mansions of the"
"Brompton Road came out clear and little in the sunrise, the jagged"
"ruins of Westminster rising hazily beyond. Far away and blue were the"
"Surrey hills, and the towers of the Crystal Palace glittered like two"
"silver rods. The dome of St. Paul’s was dark against the sunrise, and"
"injured, I saw for the first time, by a huge gaping cavity on its"
"western side."
"And as I looked at this wide expanse of houses and factories and"
"churches, silent and abandoned; as I thought of the multitudinous hopes"
"and efforts, the innumerable hosts of lives that had gone to build this"
"human reef, and of the swift and ruthless destruction that had hung"
"over it all; when I realised that the shadow had been rolled back, and"
"that men might still live in the streets, and this dear vast dead city"
"of mine be once more alive and powerful, I felt a wave of emotion that"
"was near akin to tears."
"The torment was over. Even that day the healing would begin. The"
"survivors of the people scattered over the country—leaderless, lawless,"
"foodless, like sheep without a shepherd—the thousands who had fled by"
"sea, would begin to return; the pulse of life, growing stronger and"
"stronger, would beat again in the empty streets and pour across the"
"vacant squares. Whatever destruction was done, the hand of the"
"destroyer was stayed. All the gaunt wrecks, the blackened skeletons of"
"houses that stared so dismally at the sunlit grass of the hill, would"
"presently be echoing with the hammers of the restorers and ringing with"
"the tapping of their trowels. At the thought I extended my hands"
"towards the sky and began thanking God. In a year, thought I—in a year."
". . ."
"With overwhelming force came the thought of myself, of my wife, and the"
"old life of hope and tender helpfulness that had ceased for ever."
"IX."
"WRECKAGE."
"And now comes the strangest thing in my story. Yet, perhaps, it is not"
"altogether strange. I remember, clearly and coldly and vividly, all"
"that I did that day until the time that I stood weeping and praising"
"God upon the summit of Primrose Hill. And then I forget."
"Of the next three days I know nothing. I have learned since that, so"
"far from my being the first discoverer of the Martian overthrow,"
"several such wanderers as myself had already discovered this on the"
"previous night. One man—the first—had gone to St. Martin’s-le-Grand,"
"and, while I sheltered in the cabmen’s hut, had contrived to telegraph"
"to Paris. Thence the joyful news had flashed all over the world; a"
"thousand cities, chilled by ghastly apprehensions, suddenly flashed"
"into frantic illuminations; they knew of it in Dublin, Edinburgh,"
"Manchester, Birmingham, at the time when I stood upon the verge of the"
"pit. Already men, weeping with joy, as I have heard, shouting and"
"staying their work to shake hands and shout, were making up trains,"
"even as near as Crewe, to descend upon London. The church bells that"
"had ceased a fortnight since suddenly caught the news, until all"
"England was bell-ringing. Men on cycles, lean-faced, unkempt, scorched"
"along every country lane shouting of unhoped deliverance, shouting to"
"gaunt, staring figures of despair. And for the food! Across the"
"Channel, across the Irish Sea, across the Atlantic, corn, bread, and"
"meat were tearing to our relief. All the shipping in the world seemed"
"going Londonward in those days. But of all this I have no memory. I"
"drifted—a demented man. I found myself in a house of kindly people, who"
"had found me on the third day wandering, weeping, and raving through"
"the streets of St. John’s Wood. They have told me since that I was"
"singing some insane doggerel about “The Last Man Left Alive! Hurrah!"
"The Last Man Left Alive!” Troubled as they were with their own affairs,"
"these people, whose name, much as I would like to express my gratitude"
"to them, I may not even give here, nevertheless cumbered themselves"
"with me, sheltered me, and protected me from myself. Apparently they"
"had learned something of my story from me during the days of my lapse."
"Very gently, when my mind was assured again, did they break to me what"
"they had learned of the fate of Leatherhead. Two days after I was"
"imprisoned it had been destroyed, with every soul in it, by a Martian."
"He had swept it out of existence, as it seemed, without any"
"provocation, as a boy might crush an ant hill, in the mere wantonness"
"of power."
"I was a lonely man, and they were very kind to me. I was a lonely man"
"and a sad one, and they bore with me. I remained with them four days"
"after my recovery. All that time I felt a vague, a growing craving to"
"look once more on whatever remained of the little life that seemed so"
"happy and bright in my past. It was a mere hopeless desire to feast"
"upon my misery. They dissuaded me. They did all they could to divert me"
"from this morbidity. But at last I could resist the impulse no longer,"
"and, promising faithfully to return to them, and parting, as I will"
"confess, from these four-day friends with tears, I went out again into"
"the streets that had lately been so dark and strange and empty."
"Already they were busy with returning people; in places even there were"
"shops open, and I saw a drinking fountain running water."
"I remember how mockingly bright the day seemed as I went back on my"
"melancholy pilgrimage to the little house at Woking, how busy the"
"streets and vivid the moving life about me. So many people were abroad"
"everywhere, busied in a thousand activities, that it seemed incredible"
"that any great proportion of the population could have been slain. But"
"then I noticed how yellow were the skins of the people I met, how"
"shaggy the hair of the men, how large and bright their eyes, and that"
"every other man still wore his dirty rags. Their faces seemed all with"
"one of two expressions—a leaping exultation and energy or a grim"
"resolution. Save for the expression of the faces, London seemed a city"
"of tramps. The vestries were indiscriminately distributing bread sent"
"us by the French government. The ribs of the few horses showed"
"dismally. Haggard special constables with white badges stood at the"
"corners of every street. I saw little of the mischief wrought by the"
"Martians until I reached Wellington Street, and there I saw the red"
"weed clambering over the buttresses of Waterloo Bridge."
"At the corner of the bridge, too, I saw one of the common contrasts of"
"that grotesque time—a sheet of paper flaunting against a thicket of the"
"red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place. It was the"
"placard of the first newspaper to resume publication—the _Daily Mail_."
"I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket. Most of"
"it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing had"
"amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on"
"the back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the news"
"organisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing fresh"
"except that already in one week the examination of the Martian"
"mechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, the"
"article assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the “Secret"
"of Flying,” was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains that"
"were taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over."
"There were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casual"
"conversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms,"
"looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows."
"And just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails,"
"and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. To"
"Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the Black"
"Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham"
"Junction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of"
"out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary"
"navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying."
"All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and"
"unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue of"
"its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the"
"line. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of"
"red weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage. The"
"Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the red"
"climber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nursery"
"grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder. A"
"number of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy in"
"the midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in"
"the morning breeze. The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with"
"the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, and"
"very painful to the eye. One’s gaze went with infinite relief from the"
"scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green"
"softness of the eastward hills."
"The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing"
"repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury,"
"past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars,"
"and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the"
"thunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a"
"tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened"
"bones of the horse scattered and gnawed. For a time I stood regarding"
"these vestiges. . . ."
"Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and"
"there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found"
"burial, and so came home past the College Arms. A man standing at an"
"open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed."
"I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately."
"The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I"
"approached."
"It slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open"
"window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn. No one"
"had closed it since. The smashed bushes were just as I had left them"
"nearly four weeks ago. I stumbled into the hall, and the house felt"
"empty. The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had"
"crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the"
"catastrophe. Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs."
"I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table still,"
"with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had left on"
"the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder. For a space I stood"
"reading over my abandoned arguments. It was a paper on the probable"
"development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising"
"process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: “In about"
"two hundred years,” I had written, “we may expect——” The sentence ended"
"abruptly. I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning,"
"scarcely a month gone by, and how I had broken off to get my _Daily"
"Chronicle_ from the newsboy. I remembered how I went down to the garden"
"gate as he came along, and how I had listened to his odd story of “Men"
"from Mars.”"
"I came down and went into the dining room. There were the mutton and"
"the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle overturned,"
"just as I and the artilleryman had left them. My home was desolate. I"
"perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so long. And then"
"a strange thing occurred. “It is no use,” said a voice. “The house is"
"deserted. No one has been here these ten days. Do not stay here to"
"torment yourself. No one escaped but you.”"
"I was startled. Had I spoken my thought aloud? I turned, and the French"
"window was open behind me. I made a step to it, and stood looking out."
"And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid, were"
"my cousin and my wife—my wife white and tearless. She gave a faint cry."
"“I came,” she said. “I knew—knew——”"
"She put her hand to her throat—swayed. I made a step forward, and"
"caught her in my arms."
"X."
"THE EPILOGUE."
"I cannot but regret, now that I am concluding my story, how little I am"
"able to contribute to the discussion of the many debatable questions"
"which are still unsettled. In one respect I shall certainly provoke"
"criticism. My particular province is speculative philosophy. My"
"knowledge of comparative physiology is confined to a book or two, but"
"it seems to me that Carver’s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid"
"death of the Martians is so probable as to be regarded almost as a"
"proven conclusion. I have assumed that in the body of my narrative."
"At any rate, in all the bodies of the Martians that were examined after"
"the war, no bacteria except those already known as terrestrial species"
"were found. That they did not bury any of their dead, and the reckless"
"slaughter they perpetrated, point also to an entire ignorance of the"
"putrefactive process. But probable as this seems, it is by no means a"
"proven conclusion."
"Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the Martians"
"used with such deadly effect, and the generator of the Heat-Rays"
"remains a puzzle. The terrible disasters at the Ealing and South"
"Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further"
"investigations upon the latter. Spectrum analysis of the black powder"
"points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a"
"brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that it"
"combines with argon to form a compound which acts at once with deadly"
"effect upon some constituent in the blood. But such unproven"
"speculations will scarcely be of interest to the general reader, to"
"whom this story is addressed. None of the brown scum that drifted down"
"the Thames after the destruction of Shepperton was examined at the"
"time, and now none is forthcoming."
"The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the"
"prowling dogs had left such an examination possible, I have already"
"given. But everyone is familiar with the magnificent and almost"
"complete specimen in spirits at the Natural History Museum, and the"
"countless drawings that have been made from it; and beyond that the"
"interest of their physiology and structure is purely scientific."
"A question of graver and universal interest is the possibility of"
"another attack from the Martians. I do not think that nearly enough"
"attention is being given to this aspect of the matter. At present the"
"planet Mars is in conjunction, but with every return to opposition I,"
"for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In any case, we"
"should be prepared. It seems to me that it should be possible to define"
"the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep a"
"sustained watch upon this part of the planet, and to anticipate the"
"arrival of the next attack."
"In that case the cylinder might be destroyed with dynamite or artillery"
"before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge, or they"
"might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened. It"
"seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of"
"their first surprise. Possibly they see it in the same light."
"Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians"
"have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus."
"Seven months ago now, Venus and Mars were in alignment with the sun;"
"that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view of an"
"observer on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking"
"appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost"
"simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was"
"detected upon a photograph of the Martian disk. One needs to see the"
"drawings of these appearances in order to appreciate fully their"
"remarkable resemblance in character."
"At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of"
"the human future must be greatly modified by these events. We have"
"learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a"
"secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good"
"or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in"
"the larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not"
"without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene"
"confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of"
"decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and"
"it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of"
"mankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have"
"watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson,"
"and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Be"
"that as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no"
"relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery"
"darts of the sky, the shooting stars, will bring with them as they fall"
"an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men."
"The broadening of men’s views that has resulted can scarcely be"
"exaggerated. Before the cylinder fell there was a general persuasion"
"that through all the deep of space no life existed beyond the petty"
"surface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. If the Martians can"
"reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible"
"for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth"
"uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of life"
"that has begun here will have streamed out and caught our sister planet"
"within its toils."
"Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life"
"spreading slowly from this little seed bed of the solar system"
"throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal space. But that is a"
"remote dream. It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the"
"Martians is only a reprieve. To them, and not to us, perhaps, is the"
"future ordained."
"I must confess the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding"
"sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind. I sit in my study writing by"
"lamplight, and suddenly I see again the healing valley below set with"
"writhing flames, and feel the house behind and about me empty and"
"desolate. I go out into the Byfleet Road, and vehicles pass me, a"
"butcher boy in a cart, a cabful of visitors, a workman on a bicycle,"
"children going to school, and suddenly they become vague and unreal,"
"and I hurry again with the artilleryman through the hot, brooding"
"silence. Of a night I see the black powder darkening the silent"
"streets, and the contorted bodies shrouded in that layer; they rise"
"upon me tattered and dog-bitten. They gibber and grow fiercer, paler,"
"uglier, mad distortions of humanity at last, and I wake, cold and"
"wretched, in the darkness of the night."
"I go to London and see the busy multitudes in Fleet Street and the"
"Strand, and it comes across my mind that they are but the ghosts of the"
"past, haunting the streets that I have seen silent and wretched, going"
"to and fro, phantasms in a dead city, the mockery of life in a"
"galvanised body. And strange, too, it is to stand on Primrose Hill, as"
"I did but a day before writing this last chapter, to see the great"
"province of houses, dim and blue through the haze of the smoke and"
"mist, vanishing at last into the vague lower sky, to see the people"
"walking to and fro among the flower beds on the hill, to see the"
"sight-seers about the Martian machine that stands there still, to hear"
"the tumult of playing children, and to recall the time when I saw it"
"all bright and clear-cut, hard and silent, under the dawn of that last"
"great day. . . ."
"And strangest of all is it to hold my wife’s hand again, and to think"
"that I have counted her, and that she has counted me, among the dead."

"The Island of Doctor Moreau"
"by H. G. Wells"
"Contents"
"INTRODUCTION."
"On February the First 1887, the _Lady Vain_ was lost by collision with"
"a derelict when about the latitude 1° S. and longitude 107° W."
"On January the Fifth, 1888—that is eleven months and four days after—my"
"uncle, Edward Prendick, a private gentleman, who certainly went aboard"
"the _Lady Vain_ at Callao, and who had been considered drowned, was"
"picked up in latitude 5° 3′ S. and longitude 101° W. in a small open"
"boat of which the name was illegible, but which is supposed to have"
"belonged to the missing schooner _Ipecacuanha_. He gave such a strange"
"account of himself that he was supposed demented. Subsequently he"
"alleged that his mind was a blank from the moment of his escape from"
"the _Lady Vain_. His case was discussed among psychologists at the time"
"as a curious instance of the lapse of memory consequent upon physical"
"and mental stress. The following narrative was found among his papers"
"by the undersigned, his nephew and heir, but unaccompanied by any"
"definite request for publication."
"The only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was"
"picked up is Noble’s Isle, a small volcanic islet and uninhabited. It"
"was visited in 1891 by _H. M. S. Scorpion_. A party of sailors then"
"landed, but found nothing living thereon except certain curious white"
"moths, some hogs and rabbits, and some rather peculiar rats. So that"
"this narrative is without confirmation in its most essential"
"particular. With that understood, there seems no harm in putting this"
"strange story before the public in accordance, as I believe, with my"
"uncle’s intentions. There is at least this much in its behalf: my uncle"
"passed out of human knowledge about latitude 5° S. and longitude 105°"
"E., and reappeared in the same part of the ocean after a space of"
"eleven months. In some way he must have lived during the interval. And"
"it seems that a schooner called the _Ipecacuanha_ with a drunken"
"captain, John Davies, did start from Africa with a puma and certain"
"other animals aboard in January, 1887, that the vessel was well known"
"at several ports in the South Pacific, and that it finally disappeared"
"from those seas (with a considerable amount of copra aboard), sailing"
"to its unknown fate from Bayna in December, 1887, a date that tallies"
"entirely with my uncle’s story."
"CHARLES EDWARD PRENDICK."
"The Island of Doctor Moreau"
"(The Story written by Edward Prendick.)"
"I."
"IN THE DINGEY OF THE “LADY VAIN.”"
"I do not propose to add anything to what has already been written"
"concerning the loss of the _Lady Vain_. As everyone knows, she collided"
"with a derelict when ten days out from Callao. The longboat, with seven"
"of the crew, was picked up eighteen days after by H. M. gunboat"
"_Myrtle_, and the story of their terrible privations has become quite"
"as well known as the far more horrible _Medusa_ case. But I have to add"
"to the published story of the _Lady Vain_ another, possibly as horrible"
"and far stranger. It has hitherto been supposed that the four men who"
"were in the dingey perished, but this is incorrect. I have the best of"
"evidence for this assertion: I was one of the four men."
"But in the first place I must state that there never were _four_ men in"
"the dingey,—the number was three. Constans, who was “seen by the"
"captain to jump into the gig,”[1] luckily for us and unluckily for"
"himself did not reach us. He came down out of the tangle of ropes under"
"the stays of the smashed bowsprit, some small rope caught his heel as"
"he let go, and he hung for a moment head downward, and then fell and"
"struck a block or spar floating in the water. We pulled towards him,"
"but he never came up."
" [1] _Daily News_, March 17, 1887."
"I say luckily for us he did not reach us, and I might almost say"
"luckily for himself; for we had only a small beaker of water and some"
"soddened ship’s biscuits with us, so sudden had been the alarm, so"
"unprepared the ship for any disaster. We thought the people on the"
"launch would be better provisioned (though it seems they were not), and"
"we tried to hail them. They could not have heard us, and the next"
"morning when the drizzle cleared,—which was not until past midday,—we"
"could see nothing of them. We could not stand up to look about us,"
"because of the pitching of the boat. The two other men who had escaped"
"so far with me were a man named Helmar, a passenger like myself, and a"
"seaman whose name I don’t know,—a short sturdy man, with a stammer."
"We drifted famishing, and, after our water had come to an end,"
"tormented by an intolerable thirst, for eight days altogether. After"
"the second day the sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm. It is quite"
"impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those eight days. He has"
"not, luckily for himself, anything in his memory to imagine with. After"
"the first day we said little to one another, and lay in our places in"
"the boat and stared at the horizon, or watched, with eyes that grew"
"larger and more haggard every day, the misery and weakness gaining upon"
"our companions. The sun became pitiless. The water ended on the fourth"
"day, and we were already thinking strange things and saying them with"
"our eyes; but it was, I think, the sixth before Helmar gave voice to"
"the thing we had all been thinking. I remember our voices were dry and"
"thin, so that we bent towards one another and spared our words. I stood"
"out against it with all my might, was rather for scuttling the boat and"
"perishing together among the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar"
"said that if his proposal was accepted we should have drink, the sailor"
"came round to him."
"I would not draw lots however, and in the night the sailor whispered to"
"Helmar again and again, and I sat in the bows with my clasp-knife in my"
"hand, though I doubt if I had the stuff in me to fight; and in the"
"morning I agreed to Helmar’s proposal, and we handed halfpence to find"
"the odd man. The lot fell upon the sailor; but he was the strongest of"
"us and would not abide by it, and attacked Helmar with his hands. They"
"grappled together and almost stood up. I crawled along the boat to"
"them, intending to help Helmar by grasping the sailor’s leg; but the"
"sailor stumbled with the swaying of the boat, and the two fell upon the"
"gunwale and rolled overboard together. They sank like stones. I"
"remember laughing at that, and wondering why I laughed. The laugh"
"caught me suddenly like a thing from without."
"I lay across one of the thwarts for I know not how long, thinking that"
"if I had the strength I would drink sea-water and madden myself to die"
"quickly. And even as I lay there I saw, with no more interest than if"
"it had been a picture, a sail come up towards me over the sky-line. My"
"mind must have been wandering, and yet I remember all that happened,"
"quite distinctly. I remember how my head swayed with the seas, and the"
"horizon with the sail above it danced up and down; but I also remember"
"as distinctly that I had a persuasion that I was dead, and that I"
"thought what a jest it was that they should come too late by such a"
"little to catch me in my body."
"For an endless period, as it seemed to me, I lay with my head on the"
"thwart watching the schooner (she was a little ship, schooner-rigged"
"fore and aft) come up out of the sea. She kept tacking to and fro in a"
"widening compass, for she was sailing dead into the wind. It never"
"entered my head to attempt to attract attention, and I do not remember"
"anything distinctly after the sight of her side until I found myself in"
"a little cabin aft. There’s a dim half-memory of being lifted up to the"
"gangway, and of a big round countenance covered with freckles and"
"surrounded with red hair staring at me over the bulwarks. I also had a"
"disconnected impression of a dark face, with extraordinary eyes, close"
"to mine; but that I thought was a nightmare, until I met it again. I"
"fancy I recollect some stuff being poured in between my teeth; and that"
"is all."
"II."
"THE MAN WHO WAS GOING NOWHERE."
"The cabin in which I found myself was small and rather untidy. A"
"youngish man with flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured moustache, and"
"a dropping nether lip, was sitting and holding my wrist. For a minute"
"we stared at each other without speaking. He had watery grey eyes,"
"oddly void of expression. Then just overhead came a sound like an iron"
"bedstead being knocked about, and the low angry growling of some large"
"animal. At the same time the man spoke. He repeated his question,—“How"
"do you feel now?”"
"I think I said I felt all right. I could not recollect how I had got"
"there. He must have seen the question in my face, for my voice was"
"inaccessible to me."
"“You were picked up in a boat, starving. The name on the boat was the"
"_Lady Vain_, and there were spots of blood on the gunwale.”"
"At the same time my eye caught my hand, so thin that it looked like a"
"dirty skin-purse full of loose bones, and all the business of the boat"
"came back to me."
"“Have some of this,” said he, and gave me a dose of some scarlet stuff,"
"iced."
"It tasted like blood, and made me feel stronger."
"“You were in luck,” said he, “to get picked up by a ship with a medical"
"man aboard.” He spoke with a slobbering articulation, with the ghost of"
"a lisp."
"“What ship is this?” I said slowly, hoarse from my long silence."
"“It’s a little trader from Arica and Callao. I never asked where she"
"came from in the beginning,—out of the land of born fools, I guess. I’m"
"a passenger myself, from Arica. The silly ass who owns her,—he’s"
"captain too, named Davies,—he’s lost his certificate, or something. You"
"know the kind of man,—calls the thing the _Ipecacuanha_, of all silly,"
"infernal names; though when there’s much of a sea without any wind, she"
"certainly acts according.”"
"(Then the noise overhead began again, a snarling growl and the voice of"
"a human being together. Then another voice, telling some"
"“Heaven-forsaken idiot” to desist.)"
"“You were nearly dead,” said my interlocutor. “It was a very near"
"thing, indeed. But I’ve put some stuff into you now. Notice your arm’s"
"sore? Injections. You’ve been insensible for nearly thirty hours.”"
"I thought slowly. (I was distracted now by the yelping of a number of"
"dogs.) “Am I eligible for solid food?” I asked."
"“Thanks to me,” he said. “Even now the mutton is boiling.”"
"“Yes,” I said with assurance; “I could eat some mutton.”"
"“But,” said he with a momentary hesitation, “you know I’m dying to hear"
"of how you came to be alone in that boat. _Damn that howling_!” I"
"thought I detected a certain suspicion in his eyes."
"He suddenly left the cabin, and I heard him in violent controversy with"
"some one, who seemed to me to talk gibberish in response to him. The"
"matter sounded as though it ended in blows, but in that I thought my"
"ears were mistaken. Then he shouted at the dogs, and returned to the"
"cabin."
"“Well?” said he in the doorway. “You were just beginning to tell me.”"
"I told him my name, Edward Prendick, and how I had taken to Natural"
"History as a relief from the dulness of my comfortable independence."
"He seemed interested in this. “I’ve done some science myself. I did my"
"Biology at University College,—getting out the ovary of the earthworm"
"and the radula of the snail, and all that. Lord! It’s ten years ago."
"But go on! go on! tell me about the boat.”"
"He was evidently satisfied with the frankness of my story, which I told"
"in concise sentences enough, for I felt horribly weak; and when it was"
"finished he reverted at once to the topic of Natural History and his"
"own biological studies. He began to question me closely about Tottenham"
"Court Road and Gower Street. “Is Caplatzi still flourishing? What a"
"shop that was!” He had evidently been a very ordinary medical student,"
"and drifted incontinently to the topic of the music halls. He told me"
"some anecdotes."
"“Left it all,” he said, “ten years ago. How jolly it all used to be!"
"But I made a young ass of myself,—played myself out before I was"
"twenty-one. I daresay it’s all different now. But I must look up that"
"ass of a cook, and see what he’s done to your mutton.”"
"The growling overhead was renewed, so suddenly and with so much savage"
"anger that it startled me. “What’s that?” I called after him, but the"
"door had closed. He came back again with the boiled mutton, and I was"
"so excited by the appetising smell of it that I forgot the noise of the"
"beast that had troubled me."
"After a day of alternate sleep and feeding I was so far recovered as to"
"be able to get from my bunk to the scuttle, and see the green seas"
"trying to keep pace with us. I judged the schooner was running before"
"the wind. Montgomery—that was the name of the flaxen-haired man—came in"
"again as I stood there, and I asked him for some clothes. He lent me"
"some duck things of his own, for those I had worn in the boat had been"
"thrown overboard. They were rather loose for me, for he was large and"
"long in his limbs. He told me casually that the captain was three-parts"
"drunk in his own cabin. As I assumed the clothes, I began asking him"
"some questions about the destination of the ship. He said the ship was"
"bound to Hawaii, but that it had to land him first."
"“Where?” said I."
"“It’s an island, where I live. So far as I know, it hasn’t got a name.”"
"He stared at me with his nether lip dropping, and looked so wilfully"
"stupid of a sudden that it came into my head that he desired to avoid"
"my questions. I had the discretion to ask no more."
"III."
"THE STRANGE FACE."
"We left the cabin and found a man at the companion obstructing our way."
"He was standing on the ladder with his back to us, peering over the"
"combing of the hatchway. He was, I could see, a misshapen man, short,"
"broad, and clumsy, with a crooked back, a hairy neck, and a head sunk"
"between his shoulders. He was dressed in dark-blue serge, and had"
"peculiarly thick, coarse, black hair. I heard the unseen dogs growl"
"furiously, and forthwith he ducked back,—coming into contact with the"
"hand I put out to fend him off from myself. He turned with animal"
"swiftness."
"In some indefinable way the black face thus flashed upon me shocked me"
"profoundly. It was a singularly deformed one. The facial part"
"projected, forming something dimly suggestive of a muzzle, and the huge"
"half-open mouth showed as big white teeth as I had ever seen in a human"
"mouth. His eyes were blood-shot at the edges, with scarcely a rim of"
"white round the hazel pupils. There was a curious glow of excitement in"
"his face."
"“Confound you!” said Montgomery. “Why the devil don’t you get out of"
"the way?”"
"The black-faced man started aside without a word. I went on up the"
"companion, staring at him instinctively as I did so. Montgomery stayed"
"at the foot for a moment. “You have no business here, you know,” he"
"said in a deliberate tone. “Your place is forward.”"
"The black-faced man cowered. “They—won’t have me forward.” He spoke"
"slowly, with a queer, hoarse quality in his voice."
"“Won’t have you forward!” said Montgomery, in a menacing voice. “But I"
"tell you to go!” He was on the brink of saying something further, then"
"looked up at me suddenly and followed me up the ladder."
"I had paused half way through the hatchway, looking back, still"
"astonished beyond measure at the grotesque ugliness of this black-faced"
"creature. I had never beheld such a repulsive and extraordinary face"
"before, and yet—if the contradiction is credible—I experienced at the"
"same time an odd feeling that in some way I _had_ already encountered"
"exactly the features and gestures that now amazed me. Afterwards it"
"occurred to me that probably I had seen him as I was lifted aboard; and"
"yet that scarcely satisfied my suspicion of a previous acquaintance."
"Yet how one could have set eyes on so singular a face and yet have"
"forgotten the precise occasion, passed my imagination."
"Montgomery’s movement to follow me released my attention, and I turned"
"and looked about me at the flush deck of the little schooner. I was"
"already half prepared by the sounds I had heard for what I saw."
"Certainly I never beheld a deck so dirty. It was littered with scraps"
"of carrot, shreds of green stuff, and indescribable filth. Fastened by"
"chains to the mainmast were a number of grisly staghounds, who now"
"began leaping and barking at me, and by the mizzen a huge puma was"
"cramped in a little iron cage far too small even to give it turning"
"room. Farther under the starboard bulwark were some big hutches"
"containing a number of rabbits, and a solitary llama was squeezed in a"
"mere box of a cage forward. The dogs were muzzled by leather straps."
"The only human being on deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at the"
"wheel."
"The patched and dirty spankers were tense before the wind, and up aloft"
"the little ship seemed carrying every sail she had. The sky was clear,"
"the sun midway down the western sky; long waves, capped by the breeze"
"with froth, were running with us. We went past the steersman to the"
"taffrail, and saw the water come foaming under the stern and the"
"bubbles go dancing and vanishing in her wake. I turned and surveyed the"
"unsavoury length of the ship."
"“Is this an ocean menagerie?” said I."
"“Looks like it,” said Montgomery."
"“What are these beasts for? Merchandise, curios? Does the captain think"
"he is going to sell them somewhere in the South Seas?”"
"“It looks like it, doesn’t it?” said Montgomery, and turned towards the"
"wake again."
"Suddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious blasphemy from the"
"companion hatchway, and the deformed man with the black face came up"
"hurriedly. He was immediately followed by a heavy red-haired man in a"
"white cap. At the sight of the former the staghounds, who had all tired"
"of barking at me by this time, became furiously excited, howling and"
"leaping against their chains. The black hesitated before them, and this"
"gave the red-haired man time to come up with him and deliver a"
"tremendous blow between the shoulder-blades. The poor devil went down"
"like a felled ox, and rolled in the dirt among the furiously excited"
"dogs. It was lucky for him that they were muzzled. The red-haired man"
"gave a yawp of exultation and stood staggering, and as it seemed to me"
"in serious danger of either going backwards down the companion hatchway"
"or forwards upon his victim."
"So soon as the second man had appeared, Montgomery had started forward."
"“Steady on there!” he cried, in a tone of remonstrance. A couple of"
"sailors appeared on the forecastle. The black-faced man, howling in a"
"singular voice rolled about under the feet of the dogs. No one"
"attempted to help him. The brutes did their best to worry him, butting"
"their muzzles at him. There was a quick dance of their lithe"
"grey-figured bodies over the clumsy, prostrate figure. The sailors"
"forward shouted, as though it was admirable sport. Montgomery gave an"
"angry exclamation, and went striding down the deck, and I followed him."
"The black-faced man scrambled up and staggered forward, going and"
"leaning over the bulwark by the main shrouds, where he remained,"
"panting and glaring over his shoulder at the dogs. The red-haired man"
"laughed a satisfied laugh."
"“Look here, Captain,” said Montgomery, with his lisp a little"
"accentuated, gripping the elbows of the red-haired man, “this won’t"
"do!”"
"I stood behind Montgomery. The captain came half round, and regarded"
"him with the dull and solemn eyes of a drunken man. “Wha’ won’t do?” he"
"said, and added, after looking sleepily into Montgomery’s face for a"
"minute, “Blasted Sawbones!”"
"With a sudden movement he shook his arms free, and after two"
"ineffectual attempts stuck his freckled fists into his side pockets."
"“That man’s a passenger,” said Montgomery. “I’d advise you to keep your"
"hands off him.”"
"“Go to hell!” said the captain, loudly. He suddenly turned and"
"staggered towards the side. “Do what I like on my own ship,” he said."
"I think Montgomery might have left him then, seeing the brute was"
"drunk; but he only turned a shade paler, and followed the captain to"
"the bulwarks."
"“Look you here, Captain,” he said; “that man of mine is not to be"
"ill-treated. He has been hazed ever since he came aboard.”"
"For a minute, alcoholic fumes kept the captain speechless. “Blasted"
"Sawbones!” was all he considered necessary."
"I could see that Montgomery had one of those slow, pertinacious tempers"
"that will warm day after day to a white heat, and never again cool to"
"forgiveness; and I saw too that this quarrel had been some time"
"growing. “The man’s drunk,” said I, perhaps officiously; “you’ll do no"
"good.”"
"Montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping lip. “He’s always drunk."
"Do you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers?”"
"“My ship,” began the captain, waving his hand unsteadily towards the"
"cages, “was a clean ship. Look at it now!” It was certainly anything"
"but clean. “Crew,” continued the captain, “clean, respectable crew.”"
"“You agreed to take the beasts.”"
"“I wish I’d never set eyes on your infernal island. What the devil—want"
"beasts for on an island like that? Then, that man of yours—understood"
"he was a man. He’s a lunatic; and he hadn’t no business aft. Do you"
"think the whole damned ship belongs to you?”"
"“Your sailors began to haze the poor devil as soon as he came aboard.”"
"“That’s just what he is—he’s a devil! an ugly devil! My men can’t stand"
"him. _I_ can’t stand him. None of us can’t stand him. Nor _you_"
"either!”"
"Montgomery turned away. “_You_ leave that man alone, anyhow,” he said,"
"nodding his head as he spoke."
"But the captain meant to quarrel now. He raised his voice. “If he comes"
"this end of the ship again I’ll cut his insides out, I tell you. Cut"
"out his blasted insides! Who are _you_, to tell _me_ what _I’m_ to do?"
"I tell you I’m captain of this ship,—captain and owner. I’m the law"
"here, I tell you,—the law and the prophets. I bargained to take a man"
"and his attendant to and from Arica, and bring back some animals. I"
"never bargained to carry a mad devil and a silly Sawbones, a—”"
"Well, never mind what he called Montgomery. I saw the latter take a"
"step forward, and interposed. “He’s drunk,” said I. The captain began"
"some abuse even fouler than the last. “Shut up!” I said, turning on him"
"sharply, for I had seen danger in Montgomery’s white face. With that I"
"brought the downpour on myself."
"However, I was glad to avert what was uncommonly near a scuffle, even"
"at the price of the captain’s drunken ill-will. I do not think I have"
"ever heard quite so much vile language come in a continuous stream from"
"any man’s lips before, though I have frequented eccentric company"
"enough. I found some of it hard to endure, though I am a mild-tempered"
"man; but, certainly, when I told the captain to “shut up” I had"
"forgotten that I was merely a bit of human flotsam, cut off from my"
"resources and with my fare unpaid; a mere casual dependant on the"
"bounty, or speculative enterprise, of the ship. He reminded me of it"
"with considerable vigour; but at any rate I prevented a fight."
"IV."
"AT THE SCHOONER’S RAIL."
"That night land was sighted after sundown, and the schooner hove to."
"Montgomery intimated that was his destination. It was too far to see"
"any details; it seemed to me then simply a low-lying patch of dim blue"
"in the uncertain blue-grey sea. An almost vertical streak of smoke went"
"up from it into the sky. The captain was not on deck when it was"
"sighted. After he had vented his wrath on me he had staggered below,"
"and I understand he went to sleep on the floor of his own cabin. The"
"mate practically assumed the command. He was the gaunt, taciturn"
"individual we had seen at the wheel. Apparently he was in an evil"
"temper with Montgomery. He took not the slightest notice of either of"
"us. We dined with him in a sulky silence, after a few ineffectual"
"efforts on my part to talk. It struck me too that the men regarded my"
"companion and his animals in a singularly unfriendly manner. I found"
"Montgomery very reticent about his purpose with these creatures, and"
"about his destination; and though I was sensible of a growing curiosity"
"as to both, I did not press him."
"We remained talking on the quarter deck until the sky was thick with"
"stars. Except for an occasional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle and"
"a movement of the animals now and then, the night was very still. The"
"puma lay crouched together, watching us with shining eyes, a black heap"
"in the corner of its cage. Montgomery produced some cigars. He talked"
"to me of London in a tone of half-painful reminiscence, asking all"
"kinds of questions about changes that had taken place. He spoke like a"
"man who had loved his life there, and had been suddenly and irrevocably"
"cut off from it. I gossiped as well as I could of this and that. All"
"the time the strangeness of him was shaping itself in my mind; and as I"
"talked I peered at his odd, pallid face in the dim light of the"
"binnacle lantern behind me. Then I looked out at the darkling sea,"
"where in the dimness his little island was hidden."
"This man, it seemed to me, had come out of Immensity merely to save my"
"life. To-morrow he would drop over the side, and vanish again out of my"
"existence. Even had it been under commonplace circumstances, it would"
"have made me a trifle thoughtful; but in the first place was the"
"singularity of an educated man living on this unknown little island,"
"and coupled with that the extraordinary nature of his luggage. I found"
"myself repeating the captain’s question. What did he want with the"
"beasts? Why, too, had he pretended they were not his when I had"
"remarked about them at first? Then, again, in his personal attendant"
"there was a bizarre quality which had impressed me profoundly. These"
"circumstances threw a haze of mystery round the man. They laid hold of"
"my imagination, and hampered my tongue."
"Towards midnight our talk of London died away, and we stood side by"
"side leaning over the bulwarks and staring dreamily over the silent,"
"starlit sea, each pursuing his own thoughts. It was the atmosphere for"
"sentiment, and I began upon my gratitude."
"“If I may say it,” said I, after a time, “you have saved my life.”"
"“Chance,” he answered. “Just chance.”"
"“I prefer to make my thanks to the accessible agent.”"
"“Thank no one. You had the need, and I had the knowledge; and I"
"injected and fed you much as I might have collected a specimen. I was"
"bored and wanted something to do. If I’d been jaded that day, or hadn’t"
"liked your face, well—it’s a curious question where you would have been"
"now!”"
"This damped my mood a little. “At any rate,” I began."
"“It’s a chance, I tell you,” he interrupted, “as everything is in a"
"man’s life. Only the asses won’t see it! Why am I here now, an outcast"
"from civilisation, instead of being a happy man enjoying all the"
"pleasures of London? Simply because eleven years ago—I lost my head for"
"ten minutes on a foggy night.”"
"He stopped. “Yes?” said I."
"“That’s all.”"
"We relapsed into silence. Presently he laughed. “There’s something in"
"this starlight that loosens one’s tongue. I’m an ass, and yet somehow I"
"would like to tell you.”"
"“Whatever you tell me, you may rely upon my keeping to myself—if that’s"
"it.”"
"He was on the point of beginning, and then shook his head, doubtfully."
"“Don’t,” said I. “It is all the same to me. After all, it is better to"
"keep your secret. There’s nothing gained but a little relief if I"
"respect your confidence. If I don’t—well?”"
"He grunted undecidedly. I felt I had him at a disadvantage, had caught"
"him in the mood of indiscretion; and to tell the truth I was not"
"curious to learn what might have driven a young medical student out of"
"London. I have an imagination. I shrugged my shoulders and turned away."
"Over the taffrail leant a silent black figure, watching the stars. It"
"was Montgomery’s strange attendant. It looked over its shoulder quickly"
"with my movement, then looked away again."
"It may seem a little thing to you, perhaps, but it came like a sudden"
"blow to me. The only light near us was a lantern at the wheel. The"
"creature’s face was turned for one brief instant out of the dimness of"
"the stern towards this illumination, and I saw that the eyes that"
"glanced at me shone with a pale-green light. I did not know then that a"
"reddish luminosity, at least, is not uncommon in human eyes. The thing"
"came to me as stark inhumanity. That black figure with its eyes of fire"
"struck down through all my adult thoughts and feelings, and for a"
"moment the forgotten horrors of childhood came back to my mind. Then"
"the effect passed as it had come. An uncouth black figure of a man, a"
"figure of no particular import, hung over the taffrail against the"
"starlight, and I found Montgomery was speaking to me."
"“I’m thinking of turning in, then,” said he, “if you’ve had enough of"
"this.”"
"I answered him incongruously. We went below, and he wished me"
"good-night at the door of my cabin."
"That night I had some very unpleasant dreams. The waning moon rose"
"late. Its light struck a ghostly white beam across my cabin, and made"
"an ominous shape on the planking by my bunk. Then the staghounds woke,"
"and began howling and baying; so that I dreamt fitfully, and scarcely"
"slept until the approach of dawn."
"V."
"THE MAN WHO HAD NOWHERE TO GO."
"In the early morning (it was the second morning after my recovery, and"
"I believe the fourth after I was picked up), I awoke through an avenue"
"of tumultuous dreams,—dreams of guns and howling mobs,—and became"
"sensible of a hoarse shouting above me. I rubbed my eyes and lay"
"listening to the noise, doubtful for a little while of my whereabouts."
"Then came a sudden pattering of bare feet, the sound of heavy objects"
"being thrown about, a violent creaking and the rattling of chains. I"
"heard the swish of the water as the ship was suddenly brought round,"
"and a foamy yellow-green wave flew across the little round window and"
"left it streaming. I jumped into my clothes and went on deck."
"As I came up the ladder I saw against the flushed sky—for the sun was"
"just rising—the broad back and red hair of the captain, and over his"
"shoulder the puma spinning from a tackle rigged on to the mizzen"
"spanker-boom."
"The poor brute seemed horribly scared, and crouched in the bottom of"
"its little cage."
"“Overboard with ’em!” bawled the captain. “Overboard with ’em! We’ll"
"have a clean ship soon of the whole bilin’ of ’em.”"
"He stood in my way, so that I had perforce to tap his shoulder to come"
"on deck. He came round with a start, and staggered back a few paces to"
"stare at me. It needed no expert eye to tell that the man was still"
"drunk."
"“Hullo!” said he, stupidly; and then with a light coming into his eyes,"
"“Why, it’s Mister—Mister?”"
"“Prendick,” said I."
"“Prendick be damned!” said he. “Shut-up,—that’s your name. Mister"
"Shut-up.”"
"It was no good answering the brute; but I certainly did not expect his"
"next move. He held out his hand to the gangway by which Montgomery"
"stood talking to a massive grey-haired man in dirty-blue flannels, who"
"had apparently just come aboard."
"“That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up! that way!” roared the captain."
"Montgomery and his companion turned as he spoke."
"“What do you mean?” I said."
"“That way, Mister Blasted Shut-up,—that’s what I mean! Overboard,"
"Mister Shut-up,—and sharp! We’re cleaning the ship out,—cleaning the"
"whole blessed ship out; and overboard you go!”"
"I stared at him dumfounded. Then it occurred to me that it was exactly"
"the thing I wanted. The lost prospect of a journey as sole passenger"
"with this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over. I turned towards"
"Montgomery."
"“Can’t have you,” said Montgomery’s companion, concisely."
"“You can’t have me!” said I, aghast. He had the squarest and most"
"resolute face I ever set eyes upon."
"“Look here,” I began, turning to the captain."
"“Overboard!” said the captain. “This ship aint for beasts and cannibals"
"and worse than beasts, any more. Overboard you go, Mister Shut-up. If"
"they can’t have you, you goes overboard. But, anyhow, you go—with your"
"friends. I’ve done with this blessed island for evermore, amen! I’ve"
"had enough of it.”"
"“But, Montgomery,” I appealed."
"He distorted his lower lip, and nodded his head hopelessly at the"
"grey-haired man beside him, to indicate his powerlessness to help me."
"“I’ll see to _you_, presently,” said the captain."
"Then began a curious three-cornered altercation. Alternately I appealed"
"to one and another of the three men,—first to the grey-haired man to"
"let me land, and then to the drunken captain to keep me aboard. I even"
"bawled entreaties to the sailors. Montgomery said never a word, only"
"shook his head. “You’re going overboard, I tell you,” was the captain’s"
"refrain. “Law be damned! I’m king here.” At last I must confess my"
"voice suddenly broke in the middle of a vigorous threat. I felt a gust"
"of hysterical petulance, and went aft and stared dismally at nothing."
"Meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the task of unshipping"
"the packages and caged animals. A large launch, with two standing lugs,"
"lay under the lee of the schooner; and into this the strange assortment"
"of goods were swung. I did not then see the hands from the island that"
"were receiving the packages, for the hull of the launch was hidden from"
"me by the side of the schooner. Neither Montgomery nor his companion"
"took the slightest notice of me, but busied themselves in assisting and"
"directing the four or five sailors who were unloading the goods. The"
"captain went forward interfering rather than assisting. I was"
"alternately despairful and desperate. Once or twice as I stood waiting"
"there for things to accomplish themselves, I could not resist an"
"impulse to laugh at my miserable quandary. I felt all the wretcheder"
"for the lack of a breakfast. Hunger and a lack of blood-corpuscles take"
"all the manhood from a man. I perceived pretty clearly that I had not"
"the stamina either to resist what the captain chose to do to expel me,"
"or to force myself upon Montgomery and his companion. So I waited"
"passively upon fate; and the work of transferring Montgomery’s"
"possessions to the launch went on as if I did not exist."
"Presently that work was finished, and then came a struggle. I was"
"hauled, resisting weakly enough, to the gangway. Even then I noticed"
"the oddness of the brown faces of the men who were with Montgomery in"
"the launch; but the launch was now fully laden, and was shoved off"
"hastily. A broadening gap of green water appeared under me, and I"
"pushed back with all my strength to avoid falling headlong. The hands"
"in the launch shouted derisively, and I heard Montgomery curse at them;"
"and then the captain, the mate, and one of the seamen helping him, ran"
"me aft towards the stern."
"The dingey of the _Lady Vain_ had been towing behind; it was half full"
"of water, had no oars, and was quite unvictualled. I refused to go"
"aboard her, and flung myself full length on the deck. In the end, they"
"swung me into her by a rope (for they had no stern ladder), and then"
"they cut me adrift. I drifted slowly from the schooner. In a kind of"
"stupor I watched all hands take to the rigging, and slowly but surely"
"she came round to the wind; the sails fluttered, and then bellied out"
"as the wind came into them. I stared at her weather-beaten side heeling"
"steeply towards me; and then she passed out of my range of view."
"I did not turn my head to follow her. At first I could scarcely believe"
"what had happened. I crouched in the bottom of the dingey, stunned, and"
"staring blankly at the vacant, oily sea. Then I realised that I was in"
"that little hell of mine again, now half swamped; and looking back over"
"the gunwale, I saw the schooner standing away from me, with the"
"red-haired captain mocking at me over the taffrail, and turning towards"
"the island saw the launch growing smaller as she approached the beach."
"Abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear to me. I had no"
"means of reaching the land unless I should chance to drift there. I was"
"still weak, you must remember, from my exposure in the boat; I was"
"empty and very faint, or I should have had more heart. But as it was I"
"suddenly began to sob and weep, as I had never done since I was a"
"little child. The tears ran down my face. In a passion of despair I"
"struck with my fists at the water in the bottom of the boat, and kicked"
"savagely at the gunwale. I prayed aloud for God to let me die."
"VI."
"THE EVIL-LOOKING BOATMEN."
"But the islanders, seeing that I was really adrift, took pity on me. I"
"drifted very slowly to the eastward, approaching the island slantingly;"
"and presently I saw, with hysterical relief, the launch come round and"
"return towards me. She was heavily laden, and I could make out as she"
"drew nearer Montgomery’s white-haired, broad-shouldered companion"
"sitting cramped up with the dogs and several packing-cases in the stern"
"sheets. This individual stared fixedly at me without moving or"
"speaking. The black-faced cripple was glaring at me as fixedly in the"
"bows near the puma. There were three other men besides,—three strange"
"brutish-looking fellows, at whom the staghounds were snarling savagely."
"Montgomery, who was steering, brought the boat by me, and rising,"
"caught and fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me, for there was"
"no room aboard."
"I had recovered from my hysterical phase by this time and answered his"
"hail, as he approached, bravely enough. I told him the dingey was"
"nearly swamped, and he reached me a piggin. I was jerked back as the"
"rope tightened between the boats. For some time I was busy baling."
"It was not until I had got the water under (for the water in the dingey"
"had been shipped; the boat was perfectly sound) that I had leisure to"
"look at the people in the launch again."
"The white-haired man I found was still regarding me steadfastly, but"
"with an expression, as I now fancied, of some perplexity. When my eyes"
"met his, he looked down at the staghound that sat between his knees. He"
"was a powerfully-built man, as I have said, with a fine forehead and"
"rather heavy features; but his eyes had that odd drooping of the skin"
"above the lids which often comes with advancing years, and the fall of"
"his heavy mouth at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious"
"resolution. He talked to Montgomery in a tone too low for me to hear."
"From him my eyes travelled to his three men; and a strange crew they"
"were. I saw only their faces, yet there was something in their faces—I"
"knew not what—that gave me a queer spasm of disgust. I looked steadily"
"at them, and the impression did not pass, though I failed to see what"
"had occasioned it. They seemed to me then to be brown men; but their"
"limbs were oddly swathed in some thin, dirty, white stuff down even to"
"the fingers and feet: I have never seen men so wrapped up before, and"
"women so only in the East. They wore turbans too, and thereunder peered"
"out their elfin faces at me,—faces with protruding lower-jaws and"
"bright eyes. They had lank black hair, almost like horsehair, and"
"seemed as they sat to exceed in stature any race of men I have seen."
"The white-haired man, who I knew was a good six feet in height, sat a"
"head below any one of the three. I found afterwards that really none"
"were taller than myself; but their bodies were abnormally long, and the"
"thigh-part of the leg short and curiously twisted. At any rate, they"
"were an amazingly ugly gang, and over the heads of them under the"
"forward lug peered the black face of the man whose eyes were luminous"
"in the dark. As I stared at them, they met my gaze; and then first one"
"and then another turned away from my direct stare, and looked at me in"
"an odd, furtive manner. It occurred to me that I was perhaps annoying"
"them, and I turned my attention to the island we were approaching."
"It was low, and covered with thick vegetation,—chiefly a kind of palm,"
"that was new to me. From one point a thin white thread of vapour rose"
"slantingly to an immense height, and then frayed out like a down"
"feather. We were now within the embrace of a broad bay flanked on"
"either hand by a low promontory. The beach was of dull-grey sand, and"
"sloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or seventy feet above the"
"sea-level, and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth. Half way up"
"was a square enclosure of some greyish stone, which I found"
"subsequently was built partly of coral and partly of pumiceous lava."
"Two thatched roofs peeped from within this enclosure. A man stood"
"awaiting us at the water’s edge. I fancied while we were still far off"
"that I saw some other and very grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into"
"the bushes upon the slope; but I saw nothing of these as we drew"
"nearer. This man was of a moderate size, and with a black negroid face."
"He had a large, almost lipless, mouth, extraordinary lank arms, long"
"thin feet, and bow-legs, and stood with his heavy face thrust forward"
"staring at us. He was dressed like Montgomery and his white-haired"
"companion, in jacket and trousers of blue serge. As we came still"
"nearer, this individual began to run to and fro on the beach, making"
"the most grotesque movements."
"At a word of command from Montgomery, the four men in the launch sprang"
"up, and with singularly awkward gestures struck the lugs. Montgomery"
"steered us round and into a narrow little dock excavated in the beach."
"Then the man on the beach hastened towards us. This dock, as I call it,"
"was really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of the tide to"
"take the longboat. I heard the bows ground in the sand, staved the"
"dingey off the rudder of the big boat with my piggin, and freeing the"
"painter, landed. The three muffled men, with the clumsiest movements,"
"scrambled out upon the sand, and forthwith set to landing the cargo,"
"assisted by the man on the beach. I was struck especially by the"
"curious movements of the legs of the three swathed and bandaged"
"boatmen,—not stiff they were, but distorted in some odd way, almost as"
"if they were jointed in the wrong place. The dogs were still snarling,"
"and strained at their chains after these men, as the white-haired man"
"landed with them. The three big fellows spoke to one another in odd"
"guttural tones, and the man who had waited for us on the beach began"
"chattering to them excitedly—a foreign language, as I fancied—as they"
"laid hands on some bales piled near the stern. Somewhere I had heard"
"such a voice before, and I could not think where. The white-haired man"
"stood, holding in a tumult of six dogs, and bawling orders over their"
"din. Montgomery, having unshipped the rudder, landed likewise, and all"
"set to work at unloading. I was too faint, what with my long fast and"
"the sun beating down on my bare head, to offer any assistance."
"Presently the white-haired man seemed to recollect my presence, and"
"came up to me."
"“You look,” said he, “as though you had scarcely breakfasted.” His"
"little eyes were a brilliant black under his heavy brows. “I must"
"apologise for that. Now you are our guest, we must make you"
"comfortable,—though you are uninvited, you know.” He looked keenly into"
"my face. “Montgomery says you are an educated man, Mr. Prendick; says"
"you know something of science. May I ask what that signifies?”"
"I told him I had spent some years at the Royal College of Science, and"
"had done some researches in biology under Huxley. He raised his"
"eyebrows slightly at that."
"“That alters the case a little, Mr. Prendick,” he said, with a trifle"
"more respect in his manner. “As it happens, we are biologists here."
"This is a biological station—of a sort.” His eye rested on the men in"
"white who were busily hauling the puma, on rollers, towards the walled"
"yard. “I and Montgomery, at least,” he added. Then, “When you will be"
"able to get away, I can’t say. We’re off the track to anywhere. We see"
"a ship once in a twelve-month or so.”"
"He left me abruptly, and went up the beach past this group, and I think"
"entered the enclosure. The other two men were with Montgomery, erecting"
"a pile of smaller packages on a low-wheeled truck. The llama was still"
"on the launch with the rabbit hutches; the staghounds were still lashed"
"to the thwarts. The pile of things completed, all three men laid hold"
"of the truck and began shoving the ton-weight or so upon it after the"
"puma. Presently Montgomery left them, and coming back to me held out"
"his hand."
"“I’m glad,” said he, “for my own part. That captain was a silly ass."
"He’d have made things lively for you.”"
"“It was you,” said I, “that saved me again.”"
"“That depends. You’ll find this island an infernally rum place, I"
"promise you. I’d watch my goings carefully, if I were you. _He_—” He"
"hesitated, and seemed to alter his mind about what was on his lips. “I"
"wish you’d help me with these rabbits,” he said."
"His procedure with the rabbits was singular. I waded in with him, and"
"helped him lug one of the hutches ashore. No sooner was that done than"
"he opened the door of it, and tilting the thing on one end turned its"
"living contents out on the ground. They fell in a struggling heap one"
"on the top of the other. He clapped his hands, and forthwith they went"
"off with that hopping run of theirs, fifteen or twenty of them I should"
"think, up the beach."
"“Increase and multiply, my friends,” said Montgomery. “Replenish the"
"island. Hitherto we’ve had a certain lack of meat here.”"
"As I watched them disappearing, the white-haired man returned with a"
"brandy-flask and some biscuits. “Something to go on with, Prendick,”"
"said he, in a far more familiar tone than before. I made no ado, but"
"set to work on the biscuits at once, while the white-haired man helped"
"Montgomery to release about a score more of the rabbits. Three big"
"hutches, however, went up to the house with the puma. The brandy I did"
"not touch, for I have been an abstainer from my birth."
"VII."
"THE LOCKED DOOR."
"The reader will perhaps understand that at first everything was so"
"strange about me, and my position was the outcome of such unexpected"
"adventures, that I had no discernment of the relative strangeness of"
"this or that thing. I followed the llama up the beach, and was"
"overtaken by Montgomery, who asked me not to enter the stone enclosure."
"I noticed then that the puma in its cage and the pile of packages had"
"been placed outside the entrance to this quadrangle."
"I turned and saw that the launch had now been unloaded, run out again,"
"and was being beached, and the white-haired man was walking towards us."
"He addressed Montgomery."
"“And now comes the problem of this uninvited guest. What are we to do"
"with him?”"
"“He knows something of science,” said Montgomery."
"“I’m itching to get to work again—with this new stuff,” said the"
"white-haired man, nodding towards the enclosure. His eyes grew"
"brighter."
"“I daresay you are,” said Montgomery, in anything but a cordial tone."
"“We can’t send him over there, and we can’t spare the time to build him"
"a new shanty; and we certainly can’t take him into our confidence just"
"yet.”"
"“I’m in your hands,” said I. I had no idea of what he meant by “over"
"there.”"
"“I’ve been thinking of the same things,” Montgomery answered. “There’s"
"my room with the outer door—”"
"“That’s it,” said the elder man, promptly, looking at Montgomery; and"
"all three of us went towards the enclosure. “I’m sorry to make a"
"mystery, Mr. Prendick; but you’ll remember you’re uninvited. Our little"
"establishment here contains a secret or so, is a kind of Blue-Beard’s"
"chamber, in fact. Nothing very dreadful, really, to a sane man; but"
"just now, as we don’t know you—”"
"“Decidedly,” said I, “I should be a fool to take offence at any want of"
"confidence.”"
"He twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile—he was one of those"
"saturnine people who smile with the corners of the mouth down,—and"
"bowed his acknowledgment of my complaisance. The main entrance to the"
"enclosure was passed; it was a heavy wooden gate, framed in iron and"
"locked, with the cargo of the launch piled outside it, and at the"
"corner we came to a small doorway I had not previously observed. The"
"white-haired man produced a bundle of keys from the pocket of his"
"greasy blue jacket, opened this door, and entered. His keys, and the"
"elaborate locking-up of the place even while it was still under his"
"eye, struck me as peculiar. I followed him, and found myself in a small"
"apartment, plainly but not uncomfortably furnished and with its inner"
"door, which was slightly ajar, opening into a paved courtyard. This"
"inner door Montgomery at once closed. A hammock was slung across the"
"darker corner of the room, and a small unglazed window defended by an"
"iron bar looked out towards the sea."
"This the white-haired man told me was to be my apartment; and the inner"
"door, which “for fear of accidents,” he said, he would lock on the"
"other side, was my limit inward. He called my attention to a convenient"
"deck-chair before the window, and to an array of old books, chiefly, I"
"found, surgical works and editions of the Latin and Greek classics"
"(languages I cannot read with any comfort), on a shelf near the"
"hammock. He left the room by the outer door, as if to avoid opening the"
"inner one again."
"“We usually have our meals in here,” said Montgomery, and then, as if"
"in doubt, went out after the other. “Moreau!” I heard him call, and for"
"the moment I do not think I noticed. Then as I handled the books on the"
"shelf it came up in consciousness: Where had I heard the name of Moreau"
"before? I sat down before the window, took out the biscuits that still"
"remained to me, and ate them with an excellent appetite. Moreau!"
"Through the window I saw one of those unaccountable men in white,"
"lugging a packing-case along the beach. Presently the window-frame hid"
"him. Then I heard a key inserted and turned in the lock behind me."
"After a little while I heard through the locked door the noise of the"
"staghounds, that had now been brought up from the beach. They were not"
"barking, but sniffing and growling in a curious fashion. I could hear"
"the rapid patter of their feet, and Montgomery’s voice soothing them."
"I was very much impressed by the elaborate secrecy of these two men"
"regarding the contents of the place, and for some time I was thinking"
"of that and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name of Moreau; but"
"so odd is the human memory that I could not then recall that well-known"
"name in its proper connection. From that my thoughts went to the"
"indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach. I never saw"
"such a gait, such odd motions as he pulled at the box. I recalled that"
"none of these men had spoken to me, though most of them I had found"
"looking at me at one time or another in a peculiarly furtive manner,"
"quite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage. Indeed,"
"they had all seemed remarkably taciturn, and when they did speak,"
"endowed with very uncanny voices. What was wrong with them? Then I"
"recalled the eyes of Montgomery’s ungainly attendant."
"Just as I was thinking of him he came in. He was now dressed in white,"
"and carried a little tray with some coffee and boiled vegetables"
"thereon. I could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came, bending"
"amiably, and placed the tray before me on the table. Then astonishment"
"paralysed me. Under his stringy black locks I saw his ear; it jumped"
"upon me suddenly close to my face. The man had pointed ears, covered"
"with a fine brown fur!"
"“Your breakfast, sair,” he said."
"I stared at his face without attempting to answer him. He turned and"
"went towards the door, regarding me oddly over his shoulder. I followed"
"him out with my eyes; and as I did so, by some odd trick of unconscious"
"cerebration, there came surging into my head the phrase, “The Moreau"
"Hollows”—was it? “The Moreau—” Ah! It sent my memory back ten years."
"“The Moreau Horrors!” The phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment,"
"and then I saw it in red lettering on a little buff-coloured pamphlet,"
"to read which made one shiver and creep. Then I remembered distinctly"
"all about it. That long-forgotten pamphlet came back with startling"
"vividness to my mind. I had been a mere lad then, and Moreau was, I"
"suppose, about fifty,—a prominent and masterful physiologist,"
"well-known in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagination and"
"his brutal directness in discussion."
"Was this the same Moreau? He had published some very astonishing facts"
"in connection with the transfusion of blood, and in addition was known"
"to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly his career"
"was closed. He had to leave England. A journalist obtained access to"
"his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with the"
"deliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help"
"of a shocking accident (if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet"
"became notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed"
"and otherwise mutilated, escaped from Moreau’s house. It was in the"
"silly season, and a prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary"
"laboratory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the nation. It was"
"not the first time that conscience has turned against the methods of"
"research. The doctor was simply howled out of the country. It may be"
"that he deserved to be; but I still think that the tepid support of his"
"fellow-investigators and his desertion by the great body of scientific"
"workers was a shameful thing. Yet some of his experiments, by the"
"journalist’s account, were wantonly cruel. He might perhaps have"
"purchased his social peace by abandoning his investigations; but he"
"apparently preferred the latter, as most men would who have once fallen"
"under the overmastering spell of research. He was unmarried, and had"
"indeed nothing but his own interest to consider."
"I felt convinced that this must be the same man. Everything pointed to"
"it. It dawned upon me to what end the puma and the other animals—which"
"had now been brought with other luggage into the enclosure behind the"
"house—were destined; and a curious faint odour, the halitus of"
"something familiar, an odour that had been in the background of my"
"consciousness hitherto, suddenly came forward into the forefront of my"
"thoughts. It was the antiseptic odour of the dissecting-room. I heard"
"the puma growling through the wall, and one of the dogs yelped as"
"though it had been struck."
"Yet surely, and especially to another scientific man, there was nothing"
"so horrible in vivisection as to account for this secrecy; and by some"
"odd leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous eyes of"
"Montgomery’s attendant came back again before me with the sharpest"
"definition. I stared before me out at the green sea, frothing under a"
"freshening breeze, and let these and other strange memories of the last"
"few days chase one another through my mind."
"What could it all mean? A locked enclosure on a lonely island, a"
"notorious vivisector, and these crippled and distorted men?"
"VIII."
"THE CRYING OF THE PUMA."
"Montgomery interrupted my tangle of mystification and suspicion about"
"one o’clock, and his grotesque attendant followed him with a tray"
"bearing bread, some herbs and other eatables, a flask of whiskey, a jug"
"of water, and three glasses and knives. I glanced askance at this"
"strange creature, and found him watching me with his queer, restless"
"eyes. Montgomery said he would lunch with me, but that Moreau was too"
"preoccupied with some work to come."
"“Moreau!” said I. “I know that name.”"
"“The devil you do!” said he. “What an ass I was to mention it to you! I"
"might have thought. Anyhow, it will give you an inkling of"
"our—mysteries. Whiskey?”"
"“No, thanks; I’m an abstainer.”"
"“I wish I’d been. But it’s no use locking the door after the steed is"
"stolen. It was that infernal stuff which led to my coming here,—that,"
"and a foggy night. I thought myself in luck at the time, when Moreau"
"offered to get me off. It’s queer—”"
"“Montgomery,” said I, suddenly, as the outer door closed, “why has your"
"man pointed ears?”"
"“Damn!” he said, over his first mouthful of food. He stared at me for a"
"moment, and then repeated, “Pointed ears?”"
"“Little points to them,” said I, as calmly as possible, with a catch in"
"my breath; “and a fine black fur at the edges?”"
"He helped himself to whiskey and water with great deliberation. “I was"
"under the impression—that his hair covered his ears.”"
"“I saw them as he stooped by me to put that coffee you sent to me on"
"the table. And his eyes shine in the dark.”"
"By this time Montgomery had recovered from the surprise of my question."
"“I always thought,” he said deliberately, with a certain accentuation"
"of his flavouring of lisp, “that there _was_ something the matter with"
"his ears, from the way he covered them. What were they like?”"
"I was persuaded from his manner that this ignorance was a pretence."
"Still, I could hardly tell the man that I thought him a liar."
"“Pointed,” I said; “rather small and furry,—distinctly furry. But the"
"whole man is one of the strangest beings I ever set eyes on.”"
"A sharp, hoarse cry of animal pain came from the enclosure behind us."
"Its depth and volume testified to the puma. I saw Montgomery wince."
"“Yes?” he said."
"“Where did you pick up the creature?”"
"“San Francisco. He’s an ugly brute, I admit. Half-witted, you know."
"Can’t remember where he came from. But I’m used to him, you know. We"
"both are. How does he strike you?”"
"“He’s unnatural,” I said. “There’s something about him—don’t think me"
"fanciful, but it gives me a nasty little sensation, a tightening of my"
"muscles, when he comes near me. It’s a touch—of the diabolical, in"
"fact.”"
"Montgomery had stopped eating while I told him this. “Rum!” he said."
"“_I_ can’t see it.” He resumed his meal. “I had no idea of it,” he"
"said, and masticated. “The crew of the schooner must have felt it the"
"same. Made a dead set at the poor devil. You saw the captain?”"
"Suddenly the puma howled again, this time more painfully. Montgomery"
"swore under his breath. I had half a mind to attack him about the men"
"on the beach. Then the poor brute within gave vent to a series of"
"short, sharp cries."
"“Your men on the beach,” said I; “what race are they?”"
"“Excellent fellows, aren’t they?” said he, absentmindedly, knitting his"
"brows as the animal yelled out sharply."
"I said no more. There was another outcry worse than the former. He"
"looked at me with his dull grey eyes, and then took some more whiskey."
"He tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol, professing to have"
"saved my life with it. He seemed anxious to lay stress on the fact that"
"I owed my life to him. I answered him distractedly."
"Presently our meal came to an end; the misshapen monster with the"
"pointed ears cleared the remains away, and Montgomery left me alone in"
"the room again. All the time he had been in a state of ill-concealed"
"irritation at the noise of the vivisected puma. He had spoken of his"
"odd want of nerve, and left me to the obvious application."
"I found myself that the cries were singularly irritating, and they grew"
"in depth and intensity as the afternoon wore on. They were painful at"
"first, but their constant resurgence at last altogether upset my"
"balance. I flung aside a crib of Horace I had been reading, and began"
"to clench my fists, to bite my lips, and to pace the room. Presently I"
"got to stopping my ears with my fingers."
"The emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me steadily, grew at last"
"to such an exquisite expression of suffering that I could stand it in"
"that confined room no longer. I stepped out of the door into the"
"slumberous heat of the late afternoon, and walking past the main"
"entrance—locked again, I noticed—turned the corner of the wall."
"The crying sounded even louder out of doors. It was as if all the pain"
"in the world had found a voice. Yet had I known such pain was in the"
"next room, and had it been dumb, I believe—I have thought since—I could"
"have stood it well enough. It is when suffering finds a voice and sets"
"our nerves quivering that this pity comes troubling us. But in spite of"
"the brilliant sunlight and the green fans of the trees waving in the"
"soothing sea-breeze, the world was a confusion, blurred with drifting"
"black and red phantasms, until I was out of earshot of the house in the"
"chequered wall."
"IX."
"THE THING IN THE FOREST."
"I strode through the undergrowth that clothed the ridge behind the"
"house, scarcely heeding whither I went; passed on through the shadow of"
"a thick cluster of straight-stemmed trees beyond it, and so presently"
"found myself some way on the other side of the ridge, and descending"
"towards a streamlet that ran through a narrow valley. I paused and"
"listened. The distance I had come, or the intervening masses of"
"thicket, deadened any sound that might be coming from the enclosure."
"The air was still. Then with a rustle a rabbit emerged, and went"
"scampering up the slope before me. I hesitated, and sat down in the"
"edge of the shade."
"The place was a pleasant one. The rivulet was hidden by the luxuriant"
"vegetation of the banks save at one point, where I caught a triangular"
"patch of its glittering water. On the farther side I saw through a"
"bluish haze a tangle of trees and creepers, and above these again the"
"luminous blue of the sky. Here and there a splash of white or crimson"
"marked the blooming of some trailing epiphyte. I let my eyes wander"
"over this scene for a while, and then began to turn over in my mind"
"again the strange peculiarities of Montgomery’s man. But it was too hot"
"to think elaborately, and presently I fell into a tranquil state midway"
"between dozing and waking."
"From this I was aroused, after I know not how long, by a rustling"
"amidst the greenery on the other side of the stream. For a moment I"
"could see nothing but the waving summits of the ferns and reeds. Then"
"suddenly upon the bank of the stream appeared something—at first I"
"could not distinguish what it was. It bowed its round head to the"
"water, and began to drink. Then I saw it was a man, going on all-fours"
"like a beast. He was clothed in bluish cloth, and was of a"
"copper-coloured hue, with black hair. It seemed that grotesque ugliness"
"was an invariable character of these islanders. I could hear the suck"
"of the water at his lips as he drank."
"I leant forward to see him better, and a piece of lava, detached by my"
"hand, went pattering down the slope. He looked up guiltily, and his"
"eyes met mine. Forthwith he scrambled to his feet, and stood wiping his"
"clumsy hand across his mouth and regarding me. His legs were scarcely"
"half the length of his body. So, staring one another out of"
"countenance, we remained for perhaps the space of a minute. Then,"
"stopping to look back once or twice, he slunk off among the bushes to"
"the right of me, and I heard the swish of the fronds grow faint in the"
"distance and die away. Long after he had disappeared, I remained"
"sitting up staring in the direction of his retreat. My drowsy"
"tranquillity had gone."
"I was startled by a noise behind me, and turning suddenly saw the"
"flapping white tail of a rabbit vanishing up the slope. I jumped to my"
"feet. The apparition of this grotesque, half-bestial creature had"
"suddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon for me. I looked"
"around me rather nervously, and regretted that I was unarmed. Then I"
"thought that the man I had just seen had been clothed in bluish cloth,"
"had not been naked as a savage would have been; and I tried to persuade"
"myself from that fact that he was after all probably a peaceful"
"character, that the dull ferocity of his countenance belied him."
"Yet I was greatly disturbed at the apparition. I walked to the left"
"along the slope, turning my head about and peering this way and that"
"among the straight stems of the trees. Why should a man go on all-fours"
"and drink with his lips? Presently I heard an animal wailing again, and"
"taking it to be the puma, I turned about and walked in a direction"
"diametrically opposite to the sound. This led me down to the stream,"
"across which I stepped and pushed my way up through the undergrowth"
"beyond."
"I was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet on the ground, and"
"going up to it found it to be a peculiar fungus, branched and"
"corrugated like a foliaceous lichen, but deliquescing into slime at the"
"touch; and then in the shadow of some luxuriant ferns I came upon an"
"unpleasant thing,—the dead body of a rabbit covered with shining flies,"
"but still warm and with the head torn off. I stopped aghast at the"
"sight of the scattered blood. Here at least was one visitor to the"
"island disposed of! There were no traces of other violence about it. It"
"looked as though it had been suddenly snatched up and killed; and as I"
"stared at the little furry body came the difficulty of how the thing"
"had been done. The vague dread that had been in my mind since I had"
"seen the inhuman face of the man at the stream grew distincter as I"
"stood there. I began to realise the hardihood of my expedition among"
"these unknown people. The thicket about me became altered to my"
"imagination. Every shadow became something more than a shadow,—became"
"an ambush; every rustle became a threat. Invisible things seemed"
"watching me. I resolved to go back to the enclosure on the beach. I"
"suddenly turned away and thrust myself violently, possibly even"
"frantically, through the bushes, anxious to get a clear space about me"
"again."
"I stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging upon an open space."
"It was a kind of glade in the forest, made by a fall; seedlings were"
"already starting up to struggle for the vacant space; and beyond, the"
"dense growth of stems and twining vines and splashes of fungus and"
"flowers closed in again. Before me, squatting together upon the fungoid"
"ruins of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my approach, were"
"three grotesque human figures. One was evidently a female; the other"
"two were men. They were naked, save for swathings of scarlet cloth"
"about the middle; and their skins were of a dull pinkish-drab colour,"
"such as I had seen in no savages before. They had fat, heavy, chinless"
"faces, retreating foreheads, and a scant bristly hair upon their heads."
"I never saw such bestial-looking creatures."
"They were talking, or at least one of the men was talking to the other"
"two, and all three had been too closely interested to heed the rustling"
"of my approach. They swayed their heads and shoulders from side to"
"side. The speaker’s words came thick and sloppy, and though I could"
"hear them distinctly I could not distinguish what he said. He seemed to"
"me to be reciting some complicated gibberish. Presently his"
"articulation became shriller, and spreading his hands he rose to his"
"feet. At that the others began to gibber in unison, also rising to"
"their feet, spreading their hands and swaying their bodies in rhythm"
"with their chant. I noticed then the abnormal shortness of their legs,"
"and their lank, clumsy feet. All three began slowly to circle round,"
"raising and stamping their feet and waving their arms; a kind of tune"
"crept into their rhythmic recitation, and a refrain,—“Aloola,” or"
"“Balloola,” it sounded like. Their eyes began to sparkle, and their"
"ugly faces to brighten, with an expression of strange pleasure. Saliva"
"dripped from their lipless mouths."
"Suddenly, as I watched their grotesque and unaccountable gestures, I"
"perceived clearly for the first time what it was that had offended me,"
"what had given me the two inconsistent and conflicting impressions of"
"utter strangeness and yet of the strangest familiarity. The three"
"creatures engaged in this mysterious rite were human in shape, and yet"
"human beings with the strangest air about them of some familiar animal."
"Each of these creatures, despite its human form, its rag of clothing,"
"and the rough humanity of its bodily form, had woven into it—into its"
"movements, into the expression of its countenance, into its whole"
"presence—some now irresistible suggestion of a hog, a swinish taint,"
"the unmistakable mark of the beast."
"I stood overcome by this amazing realisation and then the most horrible"
"questionings came rushing into my mind. They began leaping in the air,"
"first one and then the other, whooping and grunting. Then one slipped,"
"and for a moment was on all-fours,—to recover, indeed, forthwith. But"
"that transitory gleam of the true animalism of these monsters was"
"enough."
"I turned as noiselessly as possible, and becoming every now and then"
"rigid with the fear of being discovered, as a branch cracked or a leaf"
"rustled, I pushed back into the bushes. It was long before I grew"
"bolder, and dared to move freely. My only idea for the moment was to"
"get away from these foul beings, and I scarcely noticed that I had"
"emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees. Then suddenly traversing"
"a little glade, I saw with an unpleasant start two clumsy legs among"
"the trees, walking with noiseless footsteps parallel with my course,"
"and perhaps thirty yards away from me. The head and upper part of the"
"body were hidden by a tangle of creeper. I stopped abruptly, hoping the"
"creature did not see me. The feet stopped as I did. So nervous was I"
"that I controlled an impulse to headlong flight with the utmost"
"difficulty. Then looking hard, I distinguished through the interlacing"
"network the head and body of the brute I had seen drinking. He moved"
"his head. There was an emerald flash in his eyes as he glanced at me"
"from the shadow of the trees, a half-luminous colour that vanished as"
"he turned his head again. He was motionless for a moment, and then with"
"a noiseless tread began running through the green confusion. In another"
"moment he had vanished behind some bushes. I could not see him, but I"
"felt that he had stopped and was watching me again."
"What on earth was he,—man or beast? What did he want with me? I had no"
"weapon, not even a stick. Flight would be madness. At any rate the"
"Thing, whatever it was, lacked the courage to attack me. Setting my"
"teeth hard, I walked straight towards him. I was anxious not to show"
"the fear that seemed chilling my backbone. I pushed through a tangle of"
"tall white-flowered bushes, and saw him twenty paces beyond, looking"
"over his shoulder at me and hesitating. I advanced a step or two,"
"looking steadfastly into his eyes."
"“Who are you?” said I."
"He tried to meet my gaze. “No!” he said suddenly, and turning went"
"bounding away from me through the undergrowth. Then he turned and"
"stared at me again. His eyes shone brightly out of the dusk under the"
"trees."
"My heart was in my mouth; but I felt my only chance was bluff, and"
"walked steadily towards him. He turned again, and vanished into the"
"dusk. Once more I thought I caught the glint of his eyes, and that was"
"all."
"For the first time I realised how the lateness of the hour might affect"
"me. The sun had set some minutes since, the swift dusk of the tropics"
"was already fading out of the eastern sky, and a pioneer moth fluttered"
"silently by my head. Unless I would spend the night among the unknown"
"dangers of the mysterious forest, I must hasten back to the enclosure."
"The thought of a return to that pain-haunted refuge was extremely"
"disagreeable, but still more so was the idea of being overtaken in the"
"open by darkness and all that darkness might conceal. I gave one more"
"look into the blue shadows that had swallowed up this odd creature, and"
"then retraced my way down the slope towards the stream, going as I"
"judged in the direction from which I had come."
"I walked eagerly, my mind confused with many things, and presently"
"found myself in a level place among scattered trees. The colourless"
"clearness that comes after the sunset flush was darkling; the blue sky"
"above grew momentarily deeper, and the little stars one by one pierced"
"the attenuated light; the interspaces of the trees, the gaps in the"
"further vegetation, that had been hazy blue in the daylight, grew black"
"and mysterious. I pushed on. The colour vanished from the world. The"
"tree-tops rose against the luminous blue sky in inky silhouette, and"
"all below that outline melted into one formless blackness. Presently"
"the trees grew thinner, and the shrubby undergrowth more abundant. Then"
"there was a desolate space covered with a white sand, and then another"
"expanse of tangled bushes. I did not remember crossing the sand-opening"
"before. I began to be tormented by a faint rustling upon my right hand."
"I thought at first it was fancy, for whenever I stopped there was"
"silence, save for the evening breeze in the tree-tops. Then when I"
"turned to hurry on again there was an echo to my footsteps."
"I turned away from the thickets, keeping to the more open ground, and"
"endeavouring by sudden turns now and then to surprise something in the"
"act of creeping upon me. I saw nothing, and nevertheless my sense of"
"another presence grew steadily. I increased my pace, and after some"
"time came to a slight ridge, crossed it, and turned sharply, regarding"
"it steadfastly from the further side. It came out black and clear-cut"
"against the darkling sky; and presently a shapeless lump heaved up"
"momentarily against the sky-line and vanished again. I felt assured now"
"that my tawny-faced antagonist was stalking me once more; and coupled"
"with that was another unpleasant realisation, that I had lost my way."
"For a time I hurried on hopelessly perplexed, and pursued by that"
"stealthy approach. Whatever it was, the Thing either lacked the courage"
"to attack me, or it was waiting to take me at some disadvantage. I kept"
"studiously to the open. At times I would turn and listen; and presently"
"I had half persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned the chase, or"
"was a mere creation of my disordered imagination. Then I heard the"
"sound of the sea. I quickened my footsteps almost into a run, and"
"immediately there was a stumble in my rear."
"I turned suddenly, and stared at the uncertain trees behind me. One"
"black shadow seemed to leap into another. I listened, rigid, and heard"
"nothing but the creep of the blood in my ears. I thought that my nerves"
"were unstrung, and that my imagination was tricking me, and turned"
"resolutely towards the sound of the sea again."
"In a minute or so the trees grew thinner, and I emerged upon a bare,"
"low headland running out into the sombre water. The night was calm and"
"clear, and the reflection of the growing multitude of the stars"
"shivered in the tranquil heaving of the sea. Some way out, the wash"
"upon an irregular band of reef shone with a pallid light of its own."
"Westward I saw the zodiacal light mingling with the yellow brilliance"
"of the evening star. The coast fell away from me to the east, and"
"westward it was hidden by the shoulder of the cape. Then I recalled the"
"fact that Moreau’s beach lay to the west."
"A twig snapped behind me, and there was a rustle. I turned, and stood"
"facing the dark trees. I could see nothing—or else I could see too"
"much. Every dark form in the dimness had its ominous quality, its"
"peculiar suggestion of alert watchfulness. So I stood for perhaps a"
"minute, and then, with an eye to the trees still, turned westward to"
"cross the headland; and as I moved, one among the lurking shadows moved"
"to follow me."
"My heart beat quickly. Presently the broad sweep of a bay to the"
"westward became visible, and I halted again. The noiseless shadow"
"halted a dozen yards from me. A little point of light shone on the"
"further bend of the curve, and the grey sweep of the sandy beach lay"
"faint under the starlight. Perhaps two miles away was that little point"
"of light. To get to the beach I should have to go through the trees"
"where the shadows lurked, and down a bushy slope."
"I could see the Thing rather more distinctly now. It was no animal, for"
"it stood erect. At that I opened my mouth to speak, and found a hoarse"
"phlegm choked my voice. I tried again, and shouted, “Who is there?”"
"There was no answer. I advanced a step. The Thing did not move, only"
"gathered itself together. My foot struck a stone. That gave me an idea."
"Without taking my eyes off the black form before me, I stooped and"
"picked up this lump of rock; but at my motion the Thing turned abruptly"
"as a dog might have done, and slunk obliquely into the further"
"darkness. Then I recalled a schoolboy expedient against big dogs, and"
"twisted the rock into my handkerchief, and gave this a turn round my"
"wrist. I heard a movement further off among the shadows, as if the"
"Thing was in retreat. Then suddenly my tense excitement gave way; I"
"broke into a profuse perspiration and fell a-trembling, with my"
"adversary routed and this weapon in my hand."
"It was some time before I could summon resolution to go down through"
"the trees and bushes upon the flank of the headland to the beach. At"
"last I did it at a run; and as I emerged from the thicket upon the"
"sand, I heard some other body come crashing after me. At that I"
"completely lost my head with fear, and began running along the sand."
"Forthwith there came the swift patter of soft feet in pursuit. I gave a"
"wild cry, and redoubled my pace. Some dim, black things about three or"
"four times the size of rabbits went running or hopping up from the"
"beach towards the bushes as I passed."
"So long as I live, I shall remember the terror of that chase. I ran"
"near the water’s edge, and heard every now and then the splash of the"
"feet that gained upon me. Far away, hopelessly far, was the yellow"
"light. All the night about us was black and still. Splash, splash, came"
"the pursuing feet, nearer and nearer. I felt my breath going, for I was"
"quite out of training; it whooped as I drew it, and I felt a pain like"
"a knife at my side. I perceived the Thing would come up with me long"
"before I reached the enclosure, and, desperate and sobbing for my"
"breath, I wheeled round upon it and struck at it as it came up to"
"me,—struck with all my strength. The stone came out of the sling of the"
"handkerchief as I did so. As I turned, the Thing, which had been"
"running on all-fours, rose to its feet, and the missile fell fair on"
"its left temple. The skull rang loud, and the animal-man blundered into"
"me, thrust me back with its hands, and went staggering past me to fall"
"headlong upon the sand with its face in the water; and there it lay"
"still."
"I could not bring myself to approach that black heap. I left it there,"
"with the water rippling round it, under the still stars, and giving it"
"a wide berth pursued my way towards the yellow glow of the house; and"
"presently, with a positive effect of relief, came the pitiful moaning"
"of the puma, the sound that had originally driven me out to explore"
"this mysterious island. At that, though I was faint and horribly"
"fatigued, I gathered together all my strength, and began running again"
"towards the light. I thought I heard a voice calling me."
"X."
"THE CRYING OF THE MAN."
"As I drew near the house I saw that the light shone from the open door"
"of my room; and then I heard coming from out of the darkness at the"
"side of that orange oblong of light, the voice of Montgomery shouting,"
"“Prendick!” I continued running. Presently I heard him again. I replied"
"by a feeble “Hullo!” and in another moment had staggered up to him."
"“Where have you been?” said he, holding me at arm’s length, so that the"
"light from the door fell on my face. “We have both been so busy that we"
"forgot you until about half an hour ago.” He led me into the room and"
"sat me down in the deck chair. For awhile I was blinded by the light."
"“We did not think you would start to explore this island of ours"
"without telling us,” he said; and then, “I was afraid—But—what—Hullo!”"
"My last remaining strength slipped from me, and my head fell forward on"
"my chest. I think he found a certain satisfaction in giving me brandy."
"“For God’s sake,” said I, “fasten that door.”"
"“You’ve been meeting some of our curiosities, eh?” said he."
"He locked the door and turned to me again. He asked me no questions,"
"but gave me some more brandy and water and pressed me to eat. I was in"
"a state of collapse. He said something vague about his forgetting to"
"warn me, and asked me briefly when I left the house and what I had"
"seen."
"I answered him as briefly, in fragmentary sentences. “Tell me what it"
"all means,” said I, in a state bordering on hysterics."
"“It’s nothing so very dreadful,” said he. “But I think you have had"
"about enough for one day.” The puma suddenly gave a sharp yell of pain."
"At that he swore under his breath. “I’m damned,” said he, “if this"
"place is not as bad as Gower Street, with its cats.”"
"“Montgomery,” said I, “what was that thing that came after me? Was it a"
"beast or was it a man?”"
"“If you don’t sleep to-night,” he said, “you’ll be off your head"
"to-morrow.”"
"I stood up in front of him. “What was that thing that came after me?” I"
"asked."
"He looked me squarely in the eyes, and twisted his mouth askew. His"
"eyes, which had seemed animated a minute before, went dull. “From your"
"account,” said he, “I’m thinking it was a bogle.”"
"I felt a gust of intense irritation, which passed as quickly as it"
"came. I flung myself into the chair again, and pressed my hands on my"
"forehead. The puma began once more."
"Montgomery came round behind me and put his hand on my shoulder. “Look"
"here, Prendick,” he said, “I had no business to let you drift out into"
"this silly island of ours. But it’s not so bad as you feel, man. Your"
"nerves are worked to rags. Let me give you something that will make you"
"sleep. _That_—will keep on for hours yet. You must simply get to sleep,"
"or I won’t answer for it.”"
"I did not reply. I bowed forward, and covered my face with my hands."
"Presently he returned with a small measure containing a dark liquid."
"This he gave me. I took it unresistingly, and he helped me into the"
"hammock."
"When I awoke, it was broad day. For a little while I lay flat, staring"
"at the roof above me. The rafters, I observed, were made out of the"
"timbers of a ship. Then I turned my head, and saw a meal prepared for"
"me on the table. I perceived that I was hungry, and prepared to clamber"
"out of the hammock, which, very politely anticipating my intention,"
"twisted round and deposited me upon all-fours on the floor."
"I got up and sat down before the food. I had a heavy feeling in my"
"head, and only the vaguest memory at first of the things that had"
"happened over night. The morning breeze blew very pleasantly through"
"the unglazed window, and that and the food contributed to the sense of"
"animal comfort which I experienced. Presently the door behind me—the"
"door inward towards the yard of the enclosure—opened. I turned and saw"
"Montgomery’s face."
"“All right,” said he. “I’m frightfully busy.” And he shut the door."
"Afterwards I discovered that he forgot to re-lock it. Then I recalled"
"the expression of his face the previous night, and with that the memory"
"of all I had experienced reconstructed itself before me. Even as that"
"fear came back to me came a cry from within; but this time it was not"
"the cry of a puma. I put down the mouthful that hesitated upon my lips,"
"and listened. Silence, save for the whisper of the morning breeze. I"
"began to think my ears had deceived me."
"After a long pause I resumed my meal, but with my ears still vigilant."
"Presently I heard something else, very faint and low. I sat as if"
"frozen in my attitude. Though it was faint and low, it moved me more"
"profoundly than all that I had hitherto heard of the abominations"
"behind the wall. There was no mistake this time in the quality of the"
"dim, broken sounds; no doubt at all of their source. For it was"
"groaning, broken by sobs and gasps of anguish. It was no brute this"
"time; it was a human being in torment!"
"As I realised this I rose, and in three steps had crossed the room,"
"seized the handle of the door into the yard, and flung it open before"
"me."
"“Prendick, man! Stop!” cried Montgomery, intervening."
"A startled deerhound yelped and snarled. There was blood, I saw, in the"
"sink,—brown, and some scarlet—and I smelt the peculiar smell of"
"carbolic acid. Then through an open doorway beyond, in the dim light of"
"the shadow, I saw something bound painfully upon a framework, scarred,"
"red, and bandaged; and then blotting this out appeared the face of old"
"Moreau, white and terrible. In a moment he had gripped me by the"
"shoulder with a hand that was smeared red, had twisted me off my feet,"
"and flung me headlong back into my own room. He lifted me as though I"
"was a little child. I fell at full length upon the floor, and the door"
"slammed and shut out the passionate intensity of his face. Then I heard"
"the key turn in the lock, and Montgomery’s voice in expostulation."
"“Ruin the work of a lifetime,” I heard Moreau say."
"“He does not understand,” said Montgomery. and other things that were"
"inaudible."
"“I can’t spare the time yet,” said Moreau."
"The rest I did not hear. I picked myself up and stood trembling, my"
"mind a chaos of the most horrible misgivings. Could it be possible, I"
"thought, that such a thing as the vivisection of men was carried on"
"here? The question shot like lightning across a tumultuous sky; and"
"suddenly the clouded horror of my mind condensed into a vivid"
"realisation of my own danger."
"XI."
"THE HUNTING OF THE MAN."
"It came before my mind with an unreasonable hope of escape that the"
"outer door of my room was still open to me. I was convinced now,"
"absolutely assured, that Moreau had been vivisecting a human being. All"
"the time since I had heard his name, I had been trying to link in my"
"mind in some way the grotesque animalism of the islanders with his"
"abominations; and now I thought I saw it all. The memory of his work on"
"the transfusion of blood recurred to me. These creatures I had seen"
"were the victims of some hideous experiment. These sickening scoundrels"
"had merely intended to keep me back, to fool me with their display of"
"confidence, and presently to fall upon me with a fate more horrible"
"than death,—with torture; and after torture the most hideous"
"degradation it is possible to conceive,—to send me off a lost soul, a"
"beast, to the rest of their Comus rout."
"I looked round for some weapon. Nothing. Then with an inspiration I"
"turned over the deck chair, put my foot on the side of it, and tore"
"away the side rail. It happened that a nail came away with the wood,"
"and projecting, gave a touch of danger to an otherwise petty weapon. I"
"heard a step outside, and incontinently flung open the door and found"
"Montgomery within a yard of it. He meant to lock the outer door! I"
"raised this nailed stick of mine and cut at his face; but he sprang"
"back. I hesitated a moment, then turned and fled, round the corner of"
"the house. “Prendick, man!” I heard his astonished cry, “don’t be a"
"silly ass, man!”"
"Another minute, thought I, and he would have had me locked in, and as"
"ready as a hospital rabbit for my fate. He emerged behind the corner,"
"for I heard him shout, “Prendick!” Then he began to run after me,"
"shouting things as he ran. This time running blindly, I went"
"northeastward in a direction at right angles to my previous expedition."
"Once, as I went running headlong up the beach, I glanced over my"
"shoulder and saw his attendant with him. I ran furiously up the slope,"
"over it, then turning eastward along a rocky valley fringed on either"
"side with jungle I ran for perhaps a mile altogether, my chest"
"straining, my heart beating in my ears; and then hearing nothing of"
"Montgomery or his man, and feeling upon the verge of exhaustion, I"
"doubled sharply back towards the beach as I judged, and lay down in the"
"shelter of a canebrake. There I remained for a long time, too fearful"
"to move, and indeed too fearful even to plan a course of action. The"
"wild scene about me lay sleeping silently under the sun, and the only"
"sound near me was the thin hum of some small gnats that had discovered"
"me. Presently I became aware of a drowsy breathing sound, the soughing"
"of the sea upon the beach."
"After about an hour I heard Montgomery shouting my name, far away to"
"the north. That set me thinking of my plan of action. As I interpreted"
"it then, this island was inhabited only by these two vivisectors and"
"their animalised victims. Some of these no doubt they could press into"
"their service against me if need arose. I knew both Moreau and"
"Montgomery carried revolvers; and, save for a feeble bar of deal spiked"
"with a small nail, the merest mockery of a mace, I was unarmed."
"So I lay still there, until I began to think of food and drink; and at"
"that thought the real hopelessness of my position came home to me. I"
"knew no way of getting anything to eat. I was too ignorant of botany to"
"discover any resort of root or fruit that might lie about me; I had no"
"means of trapping the few rabbits upon the island. It grew blanker the"
"more I turned the prospect over. At last in the desperation of my"
"position, my mind turned to the animal men I had encountered. I tried"
"to find some hope in what I remembered of them. In turn I recalled each"
"one I had seen, and tried to draw some augury of assistance from my"
"memory."
"Then suddenly I heard a staghound bay, and at that realised a new"
"danger. I took little time to think, or they would have caught me then,"
"but snatching up my nailed stick, rushed headlong from my hiding-place"
"towards the sound of the sea. I remember a growth of thorny plants,"
"with spines that stabbed like pen-knives. I emerged bleeding and with"
"torn clothes upon the lip of a long creek opening northward. I went"
"straight into the water without a minute’s hesitation, wading up the"
"creek, and presently finding myself kneedeep in a little stream. I"
"scrambled out at last on the westward bank, and with my heart beating"
"loudly in my ears, crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue. I"
"heard the dog (there was only one) draw nearer, and yelp when it came"
"to the thorns. Then I heard no more, and presently began to think I had"
"escaped."
"The minutes passed; the silence lengthened out, and at last after an"
"hour of security my courage began to return to me. By this time I was"
"no longer very much terrified or very miserable. I had, as it were,"
"passed the limit of terror and despair. I felt now that my life was"
"practically lost, and that persuasion made me capable of daring"
"anything. I had even a certain wish to encounter Moreau face to face;"
"and as I had waded into the water, I remembered that if I were too hard"
"pressed at least one path of escape from torment still lay open to"
"me,—they could not very well prevent my drowning myself. I had half a"
"mind to drown myself then; but an odd wish to see the whole adventure"
"out, a queer, impersonal, spectacular interest in myself, restrained"
"me. I stretched my limbs, sore and painful from the pricks of the spiny"
"plants, and stared around me at the trees; and, so suddenly that it"
"seemed to jump out of the green tracery about it, my eyes lit upon a"
"black face watching me. I saw that it was the simian creature who had"
"met the launch upon the beach. He was clinging to the oblique stem of a"
"palm-tree. I gripped my stick, and stood up facing him. He began"
"chattering. “You, you, you,” was all I could distinguish at first."
"Suddenly he dropped from the tree, and in another moment was holding"
"the fronds apart and staring curiously at me."
"I did not feel the same repugnance towards this creature which I had"
"experienced in my encounters with the other Beast Men. “You,” he said,"
"“in the boat.” He was a man, then,—at least as much of a man as"
"Montgomery’s attendant,—for he could talk."
"“Yes,” I said, “I came in the boat. From the ship.”"
"“Oh!” he said, and his bright, restless eyes travelled over me, to my"
"hands, to the stick I carried, to my feet, to the tattered places in my"
"coat, and the cuts and scratches I had received from the thorns. He"
"seemed puzzled at something. His eyes came back to my hands. He held"
"his own hand out and counted his digits slowly, “One, two, three, four,"
"five—eigh?”"
"I did not grasp his meaning then; afterwards I was to find that a great"
"proportion of these Beast People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes"
"even three digits. But guessing this was in some way a greeting, I did"
"the same thing by way of reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction."
"Then his swift roving glance went round again; he made a swift"
"movement—and vanished. The fern fronds he had stood between came"
"swishing together."
"I pushed out of the brake after him, and was astonished to find him"
"swinging cheerfully by one lank arm from a rope of creepers that looped"
"down from the foliage overhead. His back was to me."
"“Hullo!” said I."
"He came down with a twisting jump, and stood facing me."
"“I say,” said I, “where can I get something to eat?”"
"“Eat!” he said. “Eat Man’s food, now.” And his eye went back to the"
"swing of ropes. “At the huts.”"
"“But where are the huts?”"
"“Oh!”"
"“I’m new, you know.”"
"At that he swung round, and set off at a quick walk. All his motions"
"were curiously rapid. “Come along,” said he."
"I went with him to see the adventure out. I guessed the huts were some"
"rough shelter where he and some more of these Beast People lived. I"
"might perhaps find them friendly, find some handle in their minds to"
"take hold of. I did not know how far they had forgotten their human"
"heritage."
"My ape-like companion trotted along by my side, with his hands hanging"
"down and his jaw thrust forward. I wondered what memory he might have"
"in him. “How long have you been on this island?” said I."
"“How long?” he asked; and after having the question repeated, he held"
"up three fingers."
"The creature was little better than an idiot. I tried to make out what"
"he meant by that, and it seems I bored him. After another question or"
"two he suddenly left my side and went leaping at some fruit that hung"
"from a tree. He pulled down a handful of prickly husks and went on"
"eating the contents. I noted this with satisfaction, for here at least"
"was a hint for feeding. I tried him with some other questions, but his"
"chattering, prompt responses were as often as not quite at cross"
"purposes with my question. Some few were appropriate, others quite"
"parrot-like."
"I was so intent upon these peculiarities that I scarcely noticed the"
"path we followed. Presently we came to trees, all charred and brown,"
"and so to a bare place covered with a yellow-white incrustation, across"
"which a drifting smoke, pungent in whiffs to nose and eyes, went"
"drifting. On our right, over a shoulder of bare rock, I saw the level"
"blue of the sea. The path coiled down abruptly into a narrow ravine"
"between two tumbled and knotty masses of blackish scoriae. Into this we"
"plunged."
"It was extremely dark, this passage, after the blinding sunlight"
"reflected from the sulphurous ground. Its walls grew steep, and"
"approached each other. Blotches of green and crimson drifted across my"
"eyes. My conductor stopped suddenly. “Home!” said he, and I stood in a"
"floor of a chasm that was at first absolutely dark to me. I heard some"
"strange noises, and thrust the knuckles of my left hand into my eyes. I"
"became aware of a disagreeable odor, like that of a monkey’s cage"
"ill-cleaned. Beyond, the rock opened again upon a gradual slope of"
"sunlit greenery, and on either hand the light smote down through narrow"
"ways into the central gloom."
"XII."
"THE SAYERS OF THE LAW."
"Then something cold touched my hand. I started violently, and saw close"
"to me a dim pinkish thing, looking more like a flayed child than"
"anything else in the world. The creature had exactly the mild but"
"repulsive features of a sloth, the same low forehead and slow gestures."
"As the first shock of the change of light passed, I saw about me more"
"distinctly. The little sloth-like creature was standing and staring at"
"me. My conductor had vanished. The place was a narrow passage between"
"high walls of lava, a crack in the knotted rock, and on either side"
"interwoven heaps of sea-mat, palm-fans, and reeds leaning against the"
"rock formed rough and impenetrably dark dens. The winding way up the"
"ravine between these was scarcely three yards wide, and was disfigured"
"by lumps of decaying fruit-pulp and other refuse, which accounted for"
"the disagreeable stench of the place."
"The little pink sloth-creature was still blinking at me when my Ape-man"
"reappeared at the aperture of the nearest of these dens, and beckoned"
"me in. As he did so a slouching monster wriggled out of one of the"
"places, further up this strange street, and stood up in featureless"
"silhouette against the bright green beyond, staring at me. I hesitated,"
"having half a mind to bolt the way I had come; and then, determined to"
"go through with the adventure, I gripped my nailed stick about the"
"middle and crawled into the little evil-smelling lean-to after my"
"conductor."
"It was a semi-circular space, shaped like the half of a bee-hive; and"
"against the rocky wall that formed the inner side of it was a pile of"
"variegated fruits, cocoa-nuts among others. Some rough vessels of lava"
"and wood stood about the floor, and one on a rough stool. There was no"
"fire. In the darkest corner of the hut sat a shapeless mass of darkness"
"that grunted “Hey!” as I came in, and my Ape-man stood in the dim light"
"of the doorway and held out a split cocoa-nut to me as I crawled into"
"the other corner and squatted down. I took it, and began gnawing it, as"
"serenely as possible, in spite of a certain trepidation and the nearly"
"intolerable closeness of the den. The little pink sloth-creature stood"
"in the aperture of the hut, and something else with a drab face and"
"bright eyes came staring over its shoulder."
"“Hey!” came out of the lump of mystery opposite. “It is a man.”"
"“It is a man,” gabbled my conductor, “a man, a man, a five-man, like"
"me.”"
"“Shut up!” said the voice from the dark, and grunted. I gnawed my"
"cocoa-nut amid an impressive stillness."
"I peered hard into the blackness, but could distinguish nothing."
"“It is a man,” the voice repeated. “He comes to live with us?”"
"It was a thick voice, with something in it—a kind of whistling"
"overtone—that struck me as peculiar; but the English accent was"
"strangely good."
"The Ape-man looked at me as though he expected something. I perceived"
"the pause was interrogative. “He comes to live with you,” I said."
"“It is a man. He must learn the Law.”"
"I began to distinguish now a deeper blackness in the black, a vague"
"outline of a hunched-up figure. Then I noticed the opening of the place"
"was darkened by two more black heads. My hand tightened on my stick."
"The thing in the dark repeated in a louder tone, “Say the words.” I had"
"missed its last remark. “Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law,” it"
"repeated in a kind of sing-song."
"I was puzzled."
"“Say the words,” said the Ape-man, repeating, and the figures in the"
"doorway echoed this, with a threat in the tone of their voices."
"I realised that I had to repeat this idiotic formula; and then began"
"the insanest ceremony. The voice in the dark began intoning a mad"
"litany, line by line, and I and the rest to repeat it. As they did so,"
"they swayed from side to side in the oddest way, and beat their hands"
"upon their knees; and I followed their example. I could have imagined I"
"was already dead and in another world. That dark hut, these grotesque"
"dim figures, just flecked here and there by a glimmer of light, and all"
"of them swaying in unison and chanting,"
"“Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?"
"“Not to suck up Drink; that is the Law. Are we not Men?"
"“Not to eat Fish or Flesh; that is the Law. Are we not Men?"
"“Not to claw the Bark of Trees; _that_ is the Law. Are we not Men?"
"“Not to chase other Men; _that_ is the Law. Are we not Men?”"
"And so from the prohibition of these acts of folly, on to the"
"prohibition of what I thought then were the maddest, most impossible,"
"and most indecent things one could well imagine. A kind of rhythmic"
"fervour fell on all of us; we gabbled and swayed faster and faster,"
"repeating this amazing Law. Superficially the contagion of these brutes"
"was upon me, but deep down within me the laughter and disgust struggled"
"together. We ran through a long list of prohibitions, and then the"
"chant swung round to a new formula."
"“_His_ is the House of Pain."
"“_His_ is the Hand that makes."
"“_His_ is the Hand that wounds."
"“_His_ is the Hand that heals.”"
"And so on for another long series, mostly quite incomprehensible"
"gibberish to me about _Him_, whoever he might be. I could have fancied"
"it was a dream, but never before have I heard chanting in a dream."
"“_His_ is the lightning flash,” we sang. “_His_ is the deep, salt sea.”"
"A horrible fancy came into my head that Moreau, after animalising these"
"men, had infected their dwarfed brains with a kind of deification of"
"himself. However, I was too keenly aware of white teeth and strong"
"claws about me to stop my chanting on that account."
"“_His_ are the stars in the sky.”"
"At last that song ended. I saw the Ape-man’s face shining with"
"perspiration; and my eyes being now accustomed to the darkness, I saw"
"more distinctly the figure in the corner from which the voice came. It"
"was the size of a man, but it seemed covered with a dull grey hair"
"almost like a Skye-terrier. What was it? What were they all? Imagine"
"yourself surrounded by all the most horrible cripples and maniacs it is"
"possible to conceive, and you may understand a little of my feelings"
"with these grotesque caricatures of humanity about me."
"“He is a five-man, a five-man, a five-man—like me,” said the Ape-man."
"I held out my hands. The grey creature in the corner leant forward."
"“Not to run on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?” he said."
"He put out a strangely distorted talon and gripped my fingers. The"
"thing was almost like the hoof of a deer produced into claws. I could"
"have yelled with surprise and pain. His face came forward and peered at"
"my nails, came forward into the light of the opening of the hut and I"
"saw with a quivering disgust that it was like the face of neither man"
"nor beast, but a mere shock of grey hair, with three shadowy"
"over-archings to mark the eyes and mouth."
"“He has little nails,” said this grisly creature in his hairy beard."
"“It is well.”"
"He threw my hand down, and instinctively I gripped my stick."
"“Eat roots and herbs; it is His will,” said the Ape-man."
"“I am the Sayer of the Law,” said the grey figure. “Here come all that"
"be new to learn the Law. I sit in the darkness and say the Law.”"
"“It is even so,” said one of the beasts in the doorway."
"“Evil are the punishments of those who break the Law. None escape.”"
"“None escape,” said the Beast Folk, glancing furtively at one another."
"“None, none,” said the Ape-man,—“none escape. See! I did a little"
"thing, a wrong thing, once. I jabbered, jabbered, stopped talking. None"
"could understand. I am burnt, branded in the hand. He is great. He is"
"good!”"
"“None escape,” said the grey creature in the corner."
"“None escape,” said the Beast People, looking askance at one another."
"“For every one the want that is bad,” said the grey Sayer of the Law."
"“What you will want we do not know; we shall know. Some want to follow"
"things that move, to watch and slink and wait and spring; to kill and"
"bite, bite deep and rich, sucking the blood. It is bad. ‘Not to chase"
"other Men; that is the Law. Are we not Men? Not to eat Flesh or Fish;"
"that is the Law. Are we not Men?’”"
"“None escape,” said a dappled brute standing in the doorway."
"“For every one the want is bad,” said the grey Sayer of the Law. “Some"
"want to go tearing with teeth and hands into the roots of things,"
"snuffing into the earth. It is bad.”"
"“None escape,” said the men in the door."
"“Some go clawing trees; some go scratching at the graves of the dead;"
"some go fighting with foreheads or feet or claws; some bite suddenly,"
"none giving occasion; some love uncleanness.”"
"“None escape,” said the Ape-man, scratching his calf."
"“None escape,” said the little pink sloth-creature."
"“Punishment is sharp and sure. Therefore learn the Law. Say the words.”"
"And incontinently he began again the strange litany of the Law, and"
"again I and all these creatures began singing and swaying. My head"
"reeled with this jabbering and the close stench of the place; but I"
"kept on, trusting to find presently some chance of a new development."
"“Not to go on all-fours; that is the Law. Are we not Men?”"
"We were making such a noise that I noticed nothing of a tumult outside,"
"until some one, who I think was one of the two Swine Men I had seen,"
"thrust his head over the little pink sloth-creature and shouted"
"something excitedly, something that I did not catch. Incontinently"
"those at the opening of the hut vanished; my Ape-man rushed out; the"
"thing that had sat in the dark followed him (I only observed that it"
"was big and clumsy, and covered with silvery hair), and I was left"
"alone. Then before I reached the aperture I heard the yelp of a"
"staghound."
"In another moment I was standing outside the hovel, my chair-rail in my"
"hand, every muscle of me quivering. Before me were the clumsy backs of"
"perhaps a score of these Beast People, their misshapen heads half"
"hidden by their shoulder-blades. They were gesticulating excitedly."
"Other half-animal faces glared interrogation out of the hovels. Looking"
"in the direction in which they faced, I saw coming through the haze"
"under the trees beyond the end of the passage of dens the dark figure"
"and awful white face of Moreau. He was holding the leaping staghound"
"back, and close behind him came Montgomery revolver in hand."
"For a moment I stood horror-struck. I turned and saw the passage behind"
"me blocked by another heavy brute, with a huge grey face and twinkling"
"little eyes, advancing towards me. I looked round and saw to the right"
"of me and a half-dozen yards in front of me a narrow gap in the wall of"
"rock through which a ray of light slanted into the shadows."
"“Stop!” cried Moreau as I strode towards this, and then, “Hold him!”"
"At that, first one face turned towards me and then others. Their"
"bestial minds were happily slow. I dashed my shoulder into a clumsy"
"monster who was turning to see what Moreau meant, and flung him forward"
"into another. I felt his hands fly round, clutching at me and missing"
"me. The little pink sloth-creature dashed at me, and I gashed down its"
"ugly face with the nail in my stick and in another minute was"
"scrambling up a steep side pathway, a kind of sloping chimney, out of"
"the ravine. I heard a howl behind me, and cries of “Catch him!” “Hold"
"him!” and the grey-faced creature appeared behind me and jammed his"
"huge bulk into the cleft. “Go on! go on!” they howled. I clambered up"
"the narrow cleft in the rock and came out upon the sulphur on the"
"westward side of the village of the Beast Men."
"That gap was altogether fortunate for me, for the narrow chimney,"
"slanting obliquely upward, must have impeded the nearer pursuers. I ran"
"over the white space and down a steep slope, through a scattered growth"
"of trees, and came to a low-lying stretch of tall reeds, through which"
"I pushed into a dark, thick undergrowth that was black and succulent"
"under foot. As I plunged into the reeds, my foremost pursuers emerged"
"from the gap. I broke my way through this undergrowth for some minutes."
"The air behind me and about me was soon full of threatening cries. I"
"heard the tumult of my pursuers in the gap up the slope, then the"
"crashing of the reeds, and every now and then the crackling crash of a"
"branch. Some of the creatures roared like excited beasts of prey. The"
"staghound yelped to the left. I heard Moreau and Montgomery shouting in"
"the same direction. I turned sharply to the right. It seemed to me even"
"then that I heard Montgomery shouting for me to run for my life."
"Presently the ground gave rich and oozy under my feet; but I was"
"desperate and went headlong into it, struggled through kneedeep, and so"
"came to a winding path among tall canes. The noise of my pursuers"
"passed away to my left. In one place three strange, pink, hopping"
"animals, about the size of cats, bolted before my footsteps. This"
"pathway ran up hill, across another open space covered with white"
"incrustation, and plunged into a canebrake again. Then suddenly it"
"turned parallel with the edge of a steep-walled gap, which came without"
"warning, like the ha-ha of an English park,—turned with an unexpected"
"abruptness. I was still running with all my might, and I never saw this"
"drop until I was flying headlong through the air."
"I fell on my forearms and head, among thorns, and rose with a torn ear"
"and bleeding face. I had fallen into a precipitous ravine, rocky and"
"thorny, full of a hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps, and with a"
"narrow streamlet from which this mist came meandering down the centre."
"I was astonished at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight; but I"
"had no time to stand wondering then. I turned to my right, down-stream,"
"hoping to come to the sea in that direction, and so have my way open to"
"drown myself. It was only later I found that I had dropped my nailed"
"stick in my fall."
"Presently the ravine grew narrower for a space, and carelessly I"
"stepped into the stream. I jumped out again pretty quickly, for the"
"water was almost boiling. I noticed too there was a thin sulphurous"
"scum drifting upon its coiling water. Almost immediately came a turn in"
"the ravine, and the indistinct blue horizon. The nearer sea was"
"flashing the sun from a myriad facets. I saw my death before me; but I"
"was hot and panting, with the warm blood oozing out on my face and"
"running pleasantly through my veins. I felt more than a touch of"
"exultation too, at having distanced my pursuers. It was not in me then"
"to go out and drown myself yet. I stared back the way I had come."
"I listened. Save for the hum of the gnats and the chirp of some small"
"insects that hopped among the thorns, the air was absolutely still."
"Then came the yelp of a dog, very faint, and a chattering and"
"gibbering, the snap of a whip, and voices. They grew louder, then"
"fainter again. The noise receded up the stream and faded away. For a"
"while the chase was over; but I knew now how much hope of help for me"
"lay in the Beast People."
"XIII."
"A PARLEY."
"I turned again and went on down towards the sea. I found the hot stream"
"broadened out to a shallow, weedy sand, in which an abundance of crabs"
"and long-bodied, many-legged creatures started from my footfall. I"
"walked to the very edge of the salt water, and then I felt I was safe."
"I turned and stared, arms akimbo, at the thick green behind me, into"
"which the steamy ravine cut like a smoking gash. But, as I say, I was"
"too full of excitement and (a true saying, though those who have never"
"known danger may doubt it) too desperate to die."
"Then it came into my head that there was one chance before me yet."
"While Moreau and Montgomery and their bestial rabble chased me through"
"the island, might I not go round the beach until I came to their"
"enclosure,—make a flank march upon them, in fact, and then with a rock"
"lugged out of their loosely-built wall, perhaps, smash in the lock of"
"the smaller door and see what I could find (knife, pistol, or what not)"
"to fight them with when they returned? It was at any rate something to"
"try."
"So I turned to the westward and walked along by the water’s edge. The"
"setting sun flashed his blinding heat into my eyes. The slight Pacific"
"tide was running in with a gentle ripple. Presently the shore fell away"
"southward, and the sun came round upon my right hand. Then suddenly,"
"far in front of me, I saw first one and then several figures emerging"
"from the bushes,—Moreau, with his grey staghound, then Montgomery, and"
"two others. At that I stopped."
"They saw me, and began gesticulating and advancing. I stood watching"
"them approach. The two Beast Men came running forward to cut me off"
"from the undergrowth, inland. Montgomery came, running also, but"
"straight towards me. Moreau followed slower with the dog."
"At last I roused myself from my inaction, and turning seaward walked"
"straight into the water. The water was very shallow at first. I was"
"thirty yards out before the waves reached to my waist. Dimly I could"
"see the intertidal creatures darting away from my feet."
"“What are you doing, man?” cried Montgomery."
"I turned, standing waist deep, and stared at them. Montgomery stood"
"panting at the margin of the water. His face was bright-red with"
"exertion, his long flaxen hair blown about his head, and his dropping"
"nether lip showed his irregular teeth. Moreau was just coming up, his"
"face pale and firm, and the dog at his hand barked at me. Both men had"
"heavy whips. Farther up the beach stared the Beast Men."
"“What am I doing? I am going to drown myself,” said I."
"Montgomery and Moreau looked at each other. “Why?” asked Moreau."
"“Because that is better than being tortured by you.”"
"“I told you so,” said Montgomery, and Moreau said something in a low"
"tone."
"“What makes you think I shall torture you?” asked Moreau."
"“What I saw,” I said. “And those—yonder.”"
"“Hush!” said Moreau, and held up his hand."
"“I will not,” said I. “They were men: what are they now? I at least"
"will not be like them.”"
"I looked past my interlocutors. Up the beach were M’ling, Montgomery’s"
"attendant, and one of the white-swathed brutes from the boat. Farther"
"up, in the shadow of the trees, I saw my little Ape-man, and behind him"
"some other dim figures."
"“Who are these creatures?” said I, pointing to them and raising my"
"voice more and more that it might reach them. “They were men, men like"
"yourselves, whom you have infected with some bestial taint,—men whom"
"you have enslaved, and whom you still fear."
"“You who listen,” I cried, pointing now to Moreau and shouting past him"
"to the Beast Men,—“You who listen! Do you not see these men still fear"
"you, go in dread of you? Why, then, do you fear them? You are many—”"
"“For God’s sake,” cried Montgomery, “stop that, Prendick!”"
"“Prendick!” cried Moreau."
"They both shouted together, as if to drown my voice; and behind them"
"lowered the staring faces of the Beast Men, wondering, their deformed"
"hands hanging down, their shoulders hunched up. They seemed, as I"
"fancied, to be trying to understand me, to remember, I thought,"
"something of their human past."
"I went on shouting, I scarcely remember what,—that Moreau and"
"Montgomery could be killed, that they were not to be feared: that was"
"the burden of what I put into the heads of the Beast People. I saw the"
"green-eyed man in the dark rags, who had met me on the evening of my"
"arrival, come out from among the trees, and others followed him, to"
"hear me better. At last for want of breath I paused."
"“Listen to me for a moment,” said the steady voice of Moreau; “and then"
"say what you will.”"
"“Well?” said I."
"He coughed, thought, then shouted: “Latin, Prendick! bad Latin,"
"schoolboy Latin; but try and understand. _Hi non sunt homines; sunt"
"animalia qui nos habemus_—vivisected. A humanising process. I will"
"explain. Come ashore.”"
"I laughed. “A pretty story,” said I. “They talk, build houses. They"
"were men. It’s likely I’ll come ashore.”"
"“The water just beyond where you stand is deep—and full of sharks.”"
"“That’s my way,” said I. “Short and sharp. Presently.”"
"“Wait a minute.” He took something out of his pocket that flashed back"
"the sun, and dropped the object at his feet. “That’s a loaded"
"revolver,” said he. “Montgomery here will do the same. Now we are going"
"up the beach until you are satisfied the distance is safe. Then come"
"and take the revolvers.”"
"“Not I! You have a third between you.”"
"“I want you to think over things, Prendick. In the first place, I never"
"asked you to come upon this island. If we vivisected men, we should"
"import men, not beasts. In the next, we had you drugged last night, had"
"we wanted to work you any mischief; and in the next, now your first"
"panic is over and you can think a little, is Montgomery here quite up"
"to the character you give him? We have chased you for your good."
"Because this island is full of inimical phenomena. Besides, why should"
"we want to shoot you when you have just offered to drown yourself?”"
"“Why did you set—your people onto me when I was in the hut?”"
"“We felt sure of catching you, and bringing you out of danger."
"Afterwards we drew away from the scent, for your good.”"
"I mused. It seemed just possible. Then I remembered something again."
"“But I saw,” said I, “in the enclosure—”"
"“That was the puma.”"
"“Look here, Prendick,” said Montgomery, “you’re a silly ass! Come out"
"of the water and take these revolvers, and talk. We can’t do anything"
"more than we could do now.”"
"I will confess that then, and indeed always, I distrusted and dreaded"
"Moreau; but Montgomery was a man I felt I understood."
"“Go up the beach,” said I, after thinking, and added, “holding your"
"hands up.”"
"“Can’t do that,” said Montgomery, with an explanatory nod over his"
"shoulder. “Undignified.”"
"“Go up to the trees, then,” said I, “as you please.”"
"“It’s a damned silly ceremony,” said Montgomery."
"Both turned and faced the six or seven grotesque creatures, who stood"
"there in the sunlight, solid, casting shadows, moving, and yet so"
"incredibly unreal. Montgomery cracked his whip at them, and forthwith"
"they all turned and fled helter-skelter into the trees; and when"
"Montgomery and Moreau were at a distance I judged sufficient, I waded"
"ashore, and picked up and examined the revolvers. To satisfy myself"
"against the subtlest trickery, I discharged one at a round lump of"
"lava, and had the satisfaction of seeing the stone pulverised and the"
"beach splashed with lead. Still I hesitated for a moment."
"“I’ll take the risk,” said I, at last; and with a revolver in each hand"
"I walked up the beach towards them."
"“That’s better,” said Moreau, without affectation. “As it is, you have"
"wasted the best part of my day with your confounded imagination.” And"
"with a touch of contempt which humiliated me, he and Montgomery turned"
"and went on in silence before me."
"The knot of Beast Men, still wondering, stood back among the trees. I"
"passed them as serenely as possible. One started to follow me, but"
"retreated again when Montgomery cracked his whip. The rest stood"
"silent—watching. They may once have been animals; but I never before"
"saw an animal trying to think."
"XIV."
"DOCTOR MOREAU EXPLAINS."
"“And now, Prendick, I will explain,” said Doctor Moreau, so soon as we"
"had eaten and drunk. “I must confess that you are the most dictatorial"
"guest I ever entertained. I warn you that this is the last I shall do"
"to oblige you. The next thing you threaten to commit suicide about, I"
"shan’t do,—even at some personal inconvenience.”"
"He sat in my deck chair, a cigar half consumed in his white,"
"dexterous-looking fingers. The light of the swinging lamp fell on his"
"white hair; he stared through the little window out at the starlight. I"
"sat as far away from him as possible, the table between us and the"
"revolvers to hand. Montgomery was not present. I did not care to be"
"with the two of them in such a little room."
"“You admit that the vivisected human being, as you called it, is, after"
"all, only the puma?” said Moreau. He had made me visit that horror in"
"the inner room, to assure myself of its inhumanity."
"“It is the puma,” I said, “still alive, but so cut and mutilated as I"
"pray I may never see living flesh again. Of all vile—”"
"“Never mind that,” said Moreau; “at least, spare me those youthful"
"horrors. Montgomery used to be just the same. You admit that it is the"
"puma. Now be quiet, while I reel off my physiological lecture to you.”"
"And forthwith, beginning in the tone of a man supremely bored, but"
"presently warming a little, he explained his work to me. He was very"
"simple and convincing. Now and then there was a touch of sarcasm in his"
"voice. Presently I found myself hot with shame at our mutual positions."
"The creatures I had seen were not men, had never been men. They were"
"animals, humanised animals,—triumphs of vivisection."
"“You forget all that a skilled vivisector can do with living things,”"
"said Moreau. “For my own part, I’m puzzled why the things I have done"
"here have not been done before. Small efforts, of course, have been"
"made,—amputation, tongue-cutting, excisions. Of course you know a"
"squint may be induced or cured by surgery? Then in the case of"
"excisions you have all kinds of secondary changes, pigmentary"
"disturbances, modifications of the passions, alterations in the"
"secretion of fatty tissue. I have no doubt you have heard of these"
"things?”"
"“Of course,” said I. “But these foul creatures of yours—”"
"“All in good time,” said he, waving his hand at me; “I am only"
"beginning. Those are trivial cases of alteration. Surgery can do better"
"things than that. There is building up as well as breaking down and"
"changing. You have heard, perhaps, of a common surgical operation"
"resorted to in cases where the nose has been destroyed: a flap of skin"
"is cut from the forehead, turned down on the nose, and heals in the new"
"position. This is a kind of grafting in a new position of part of an"
"animal upon itself. Grafting of freshly obtained material from another"
"animal is also possible,—the case of teeth, for example. The grafting"
"of skin and bone is done to facilitate healing: the surgeon places in"
"the middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped from another animal, or"
"fragments of bone from a victim freshly killed. Hunter’s"
"cock-spur—possibly you have heard of that—flourished on the bull’s"
"neck; and the rhinoceros rats of the Algerian zouaves are also to be"
"thought of,—monsters manufactured by transferring a slip from the tail"
"of an ordinary rat to its snout, and allowing it to heal in that"
"position.”"
"“Monsters manufactured!” said I. “Then you mean to tell me—”"
"“Yes. These creatures you have seen are animals carven and wrought into"
"new shapes. To that, to the study of the plasticity of living forms, my"
"life has been devoted. I have studied for years, gaining in knowledge"
"as I go. I see you look horrified, and yet I am telling you nothing"
"new. It all lay in the surface of practical anatomy years ago, but no"
"one had the temerity to touch it. It is not simply the outward form of"
"an animal which I can change. The physiology, the chemical rhythm of"
"the creature, may also be made to undergo an enduring modification,—of"
"which vaccination and other methods of inoculation with living or dead"
"matter are examples that will, no doubt, be familiar to you. A similar"
"operation is the transfusion of blood,—with which subject, indeed, I"
"began. These are all familiar cases. Less so, and probably far more"
"extensive, were the operations of those mediaeval practitioners who"
"made dwarfs and beggar-cripples, show-monsters,—some vestiges of whose"
"art still remain in the preliminary manipulation of the young"
"mountebank or contortionist. Victor Hugo gives an account of them in"
"‘L’Homme qui Rit.’—But perhaps my meaning grows plain now. You begin to"
"see that it is a possible thing to transplant tissue from one part of"
"an animal to another, or from one animal to another; to alter its"
"chemical reactions and methods of growth; to modify the articulations"
"of its limbs; and, indeed, to change it in its most intimate structure."
"“And yet this extraordinary branch of knowledge has never been sought"
"as an end, and systematically, by modern investigators until I took it"
"up! Some such things have been hit upon in the last resort of surgery;"
"most of the kindred evidence that will recur to your mind has been"
"demonstrated as it were by accident,—by tyrants, by criminals, by the"
"breeders of horses and dogs, by all kinds of untrained clumsy-handed"
"men working for their own immediate ends. I was the first man to take"
"up this question armed with antiseptic surgery, and with a really"
"scientific knowledge of the laws of growth. Yet one would imagine it"
"must have been practised in secret before. Such creatures as the"
"Siamese Twins—And in the vaults of the Inquisition. No doubt their"
"chief aim was artistic torture, but some at least of the inquisitors"
"must have had a touch of scientific curiosity.”"
"“But,” said I, “these things—these animals talk!”"
"He said that was so, and proceeded to point out that the possibility of"
"vivisection does not stop at a mere physical metamorphosis. A pig may"
"be educated. The mental structure is even less determinate than the"
"bodily. In our growing science of hypnotism we find the promise of a"
"possibility of superseding old inherent instincts by new suggestions,"
"grafting upon or replacing the inherited fixed ideas. Very much indeed"
"of what we call moral education, he said, is such an artificial"
"modification and perversion of instinct; pugnacity is trained into"
"courageous self-sacrifice, and suppressed sexuality into religious"
"emotion. And the great difference between man and monkey is in the"
"larynx, he continued,—in the incapacity to frame delicately different"
"sound-symbols by which thought could be sustained. In this I failed to"
"agree with him, but with a certain incivility he declined to notice my"
"objection. He repeated that the thing was so, and continued his account"
"of his work."
"I asked him why he had taken the human form as a model. There seemed to"
"me then, and there still seems to me now, a strange wickedness for that"
"choice."
"He confessed that he had chosen that form by chance. “I might just as"
"well have worked to form sheep into llamas and llamas into sheep. I"
"suppose there is something in the human form that appeals to the"
"artistic turn of mind more powerfully than any animal shape can. But"
"I’ve not confined myself to man-making. Once or twice—” He was silent,"
"for a minute perhaps. “These years! How they have slipped by! And here"
"I have wasted a day saving your life, and am now wasting an hour"
"explaining myself!”"
"“But,” said I, “I still do not understand. Where is your justification"
"for inflicting all this pain? The only thing that could excuse"
"vivisection to me would be some application—”"
"“Precisely,” said he. “But, you see, I am differently constituted. We"
"are on different platforms. You are a materialist.”"
"“I am _not_ a materialist,” I began hotly."
"“In my view—in my view. For it is just this question of pain that parts"
"us. So long as visible or audible pain turns you sick; so long as your"
"own pains drive you; so long as pain underlies your propositions about"
"sin,—so long, I tell you, you are an animal, thinking a little less"
"obscurely what an animal feels. This pain—”"
"I gave an impatient shrug at such sophistry."
"“Oh, but it is such a little thing! A mind truly opened to what science"
"has to teach must see that it is a little thing. It may be that save in"
"this little planet, this speck of cosmic dust, invisible long before"
"the nearest star could be attained—it may be, I say, that nowhere else"
"does this thing called pain occur. But the laws we feel our way"
"towards—Why, even on this earth, even among living things, what pain is"
"there?”"
"As he spoke he drew a little penknife from his pocket, opened the"
"smaller blade, and moved his chair so that I could see his thigh. Then,"
"choosing the place deliberately, he drove the blade into his leg and"
"withdrew it."
"“No doubt,” he said, “you have seen that before. It does not hurt a"
"pin-prick. But what does it show? The capacity for pain is not needed"
"in the muscle, and it is not placed there,—is but little needed in the"
"skin, and only here and there over the thigh is a spot capable of"
"feeling pain. Pain is simply our intrinsic medical adviser to warn us"
"and stimulate us. Not all living flesh is painful; nor is all nerve,"
"not even all sensory nerve. There’s no taint of pain, real pain, in the"
"sensations of the optic nerve. If you wound the optic nerve, you merely"
"see flashes of light,—just as disease of the auditory nerve merely"
"means a humming in our ears. Plants do not feel pain, nor the lower"
"animals; it’s possible that such animals as the starfish and crayfish"
"do not feel pain at all. Then with men, the more intelligent they"
"become, the more intelligently they will see after their own welfare,"
"and the less they will need the goad to keep them out of danger. I"
"never yet heard of a useless thing that was not ground out of existence"
"by evolution sooner or later. Did you? And pain gets needless."
"“Then I am a religious man, Prendick, as every sane man must be. It may"
"be, I fancy, that I have seen more of the ways of this world’s Maker"
"than you,—for I have sought his laws, in _my_ way, all my life, while"
"you, I understand, have been collecting butterflies. And I tell you,"
"pleasure and pain have nothing to do with heaven or hell. Pleasure and"
"pain—bah! What is your theologian’s ecstasy but Mahomet’s houri in the"
"dark? This store which men and women set on pleasure and pain,"
"Prendick, is the mark of the beast upon them,—the mark of the beast"
"from which they came! Pain, pain and pleasure, they are for us only so"
"long as we wriggle in the dust."
"“You see, I went on with this research just the way it led me. That is"
"the only way I ever heard of true research going. I asked a question,"
"devised some method of obtaining an answer, and got a fresh question."
"Was this possible or that possible? You cannot imagine what this means"
"to an investigator, what an intellectual passion grows upon him! You"
"cannot imagine the strange, colourless delight of these intellectual"
"desires! The thing before you is no longer an animal, a"
"fellow-creature, but a problem! Sympathetic pain,—all I know of it I"
"remember as a thing I used to suffer from years ago. I wanted—it was"
"the one thing I wanted—to find out the extreme limit of plasticity in a"
"living shape.”"
"“But,” said I, “the thing is an abomination—”"
"“To this day I have never troubled about the ethics of the matter,” he"
"continued. “The study of Nature makes a man at last as remorseless as"
"Nature. I have gone on, not heeding anything but the question I was"
"pursuing; and the material has—dripped into the huts yonder. It is"
"nearly eleven years since we came here, I and Montgomery and six"
"Kanakas. I remember the green stillness of the island and the empty"
"ocean about us, as though it was yesterday. The place seemed waiting"
"for me."
"“The stores were landed and the house was built. The Kanakas founded"
"some huts near the ravine. I went to work here upon what I had brought"
"with me. There were some disagreeable things happened at first. I began"
"with a sheep, and killed it after a day and a half by a slip of the"
"scalpel. I took another sheep, and made a thing of pain and fear and"
"left it bound up to heal. It looked quite human to me when I had"
"finished it; but when I went to it I was discontented with it. It"
"remembered me, and was terrified beyond imagination; and it had no more"
"than the wits of a sheep. The more I looked at it the clumsier it"
"seemed, until at last I put the monster out of its misery. These"
"animals without courage, these fear-haunted, pain-driven things,"
"without a spark of pugnacious energy to face torment,—they are no good"
"for man-making."
"“Then I took a gorilla I had; and upon that, working with infinite care"
"and mastering difficulty after difficulty, I made my first man. All the"
"week, night and day, I moulded him. With him it was chiefly the brain"
"that needed moulding; much had to be added, much changed. I thought him"
"a fair specimen of the negroid type when I had finished him, and he lay"
"bandaged, bound, and motionless before me. It was only when his life"
"was assured that I left him and came into this room again, and found"
"Montgomery much as you are. He had heard some of the cries as the thing"
"grew human,—cries like those that disturbed _you_ so. I didn’t take him"
"completely into my confidence at first. And the Kanakas too, had"
"realised something of it. They were scared out of their wits by the"
"sight of me. I got Montgomery over to me—in a way; but I and he had the"
"hardest job to prevent the Kanakas deserting. Finally they did; and so"
"we lost the yacht. I spent many days educating the brute,—altogether I"
"had him for three or four months. I taught him the rudiments of"
"English; gave him ideas of counting; even made the thing read the"
"alphabet. But at that he was slow, though I’ve met with idiots slower."
"He began with a clean sheet, mentally; had no memories left in his mind"
"of what he had been. When his scars were quite healed, and he was no"
"longer anything but painful and stiff, and able to converse a little, I"
"took him yonder and introduced him to the Kanakas as an interesting"
"stowaway."
"“They were horribly afraid of him at first, somehow,—which offended me"
"rather, for I was conceited about him; but his ways seemed so mild, and"
"he was so abject, that after a time they received him and took his"
"education in hand. He was quick to learn, very imitative and adaptive,"
"and built himself a hovel rather better, it seemed to me, than their"
"own shanties. There was one among the boys a bit of a missionary, and"
"he taught the thing to read, or at least to pick out letters, and gave"
"him some rudimentary ideas of morality; but it seems the beast’s habits"
"were not all that is desirable."
"“I rested from work for some days after this, and was in a mind to"
"write an account of the whole affair to wake up English physiology."
"Then I came upon the creature squatting up in a tree and gibbering at"
"two of the Kanakas who had been teasing him. I threatened him, told him"
"the inhumanity of such a proceeding, aroused his sense of shame, and"
"came home resolved to do better before I took my work back to England."
"I have been doing better. But somehow the things drift back again: the"
"stubborn beast-flesh grows day by day back again. But I mean to do"
"better things still. I mean to conquer that. This puma—"
"“But that’s the story. All the Kanaka boys are dead now; one fell"
"overboard of the launch, and one died of a wounded heel that he"
"poisoned in some way with plant-juice. Three went away in the yacht,"
"and I suppose and hope were drowned. The other one—was killed. Well, I"
"have replaced them. Montgomery went on much as you are disposed to do"
"at first, and then—"
"“What became of the other one?” said I, sharply,—“the other Kanaka who"
"was killed?”"
"“The fact is, after I had made a number of human creatures I made a"
"Thing—” He hesitated."
"“Yes?” said I."
"“It was killed.”"
"“I don’t understand,” said I; “do you mean to say—”"
"“It killed the Kanaka—yes. It killed several other things that it"
"caught. We chased it for a couple of days. It only got loose by"
"accident—I never meant it to get away. It wasn’t finished. It was"
"purely an experiment. It was a limbless thing, with a horrible face,"
"that writhed along the ground in a serpentine fashion. It was immensely"
"strong, and in infuriating pain. It lurked in the woods for some days,"
"until we hunted it; and then it wriggled into the northern part of the"
"island, and we divided the party to close in upon it. Montgomery"
"insisted upon coming with me. The man had a rifle; and when his body"
"was found, one of the barrels was curved into the shape of an S and"
"very nearly bitten through. Montgomery shot the thing. After that I"
"stuck to the ideal of humanity—except for little things.”"
"He became silent. I sat in silence watching his face."
"“So for twenty years altogether—counting nine years in England—I have"
"been going on; and there is still something in everything I do that"
"defeats me, makes me dissatisfied, challenges me to further effort."
"Sometimes I rise above my level, sometimes I fall below it; but always"
"I fall short of the things I dream. The human shape I can get now,"
"almost with ease, so that it is lithe and graceful, or thick and"
"strong; but often there is trouble with the hands and the"
"claws,—painful things, that I dare not shape too freely. But it is in"
"the subtle grafting and reshaping one must needs do to the brain that"
"my trouble lies. The intelligence is often oddly low, with"
"unaccountable blank ends, unexpected gaps. And least satisfactory of"
"all is something that I cannot touch, somewhere—I cannot determine"
"where—in the seat of the emotions. Cravings, instincts, desires that"
"harm humanity, a strange hidden reservoir to burst forth suddenly and"
"inundate the whole being of the creature with anger, hate, or fear."
"These creatures of mine seemed strange and uncanny to you so soon as"
"you began to observe them; but to me, just after I make them, they seem"
"to be indisputably human beings. It’s afterwards, as I observe them,"
"that the persuasion fades. First one animal trait, then another, creeps"
"to the surface and stares out at me. But I will conquer yet! Each time"
"I dip a living creature into the bath of burning pain, I say, ‘This"
"time I will burn out all the animal; this time I will make a rational"
"creature of my own!’ After all, what is ten years? Men have been a"
"hundred thousand in the making.” He thought darkly. “But I am drawing"
"near the fastness. This puma of mine—” After a silence, “And they"
"revert. As soon as my hand is taken from them the beast begins to creep"
"back, begins to assert itself again.” Another long silence."
"“Then you take the things you make into those dens?” said I."
"“They go. I turn them out when I begin to feel the beast in them, and"
"presently they wander there. They all dread this house and me. There is"
"a kind of travesty of humanity over there. Montgomery knows about it,"
"for he interferes in their affairs. He has trained one or two of them"
"to our service. He’s ashamed of it, but I believe he half likes some of"
"those beasts. It’s his business, not mine. They only sicken me with a"
"sense of failure. I take no interest in them. I fancy they follow in"
"the lines the Kanaka missionary marked out, and have a kind of mockery"
"of a rational life, poor beasts! There’s something they call the Law."
"Sing hymns about ‘all thine.’ They build themselves their dens, gather"
"fruit, and pull herbs—marry even. But I can see through it all, see"
"into their very souls, and see there nothing but the souls of beasts,"
"beasts that perish, anger and the lusts to live and gratify"
"themselves.—Yet they’re odd; complex, like everything else alive. There"
"is a kind of upward striving in them, part vanity, part waste sexual"
"emotion, part waste curiosity. It only mocks me. I have some hope of"
"this puma. I have worked hard at her head and brain—"
"“And now,” said he, standing up after a long gap of silence, during"
"which we had each pursued our own thoughts, “what do you think? Are you"
"in fear of me still?”"
"I looked at him, and saw but a white-faced, white-haired man, with calm"
"eyes. Save for his serenity, the touch almost of beauty that resulted"
"from his set tranquillity and his magnificent build, he might have"
"passed muster among a hundred other comfortable old gentlemen. Then I"
"shivered. By way of answer to his second question, I handed him a"
"revolver with either hand."
"“Keep them,” he said, and snatched at a yawn. He stood up, stared at me"
"for a moment, and smiled. “You have had two eventful days,” said he. “I"
"should advise some sleep. I’m glad it’s all clear. Good-night.” He"
"thought me over for a moment, then went out by the inner door."
"I immediately turned the key in the outer one. I sat down again; sat"
"for a time in a kind of stagnant mood, so weary, emotionally, mentally,"
"and physically, that I could not think beyond the point at which he had"
"left me. The black window stared at me like an eye. At last with an"
"effort I put out the light and got into the hammock. Very soon I was"
"asleep."
"XV."
"CONCERNING THE BEAST FOLK."
"I woke early. Moreau’s explanation stood before my mind, clear and"
"definite, from the moment of my awakening. I got out of the hammock and"
"went to the door to assure myself that the key was turned. Then I tried"
"the window-bar, and found it firmly fixed. That these man-like"
"creatures were in truth only bestial monsters, mere grotesque"
"travesties of men, filled me with a vague uncertainty of their"
"possibilities which was far worse than any definite fear."
"A tapping came at the door, and I heard the glutinous accents of M’ling"
"speaking. I pocketed one of the revolvers (keeping one hand upon it),"
"and opened to him."
"“Good-morning, sair,” he said, bringing in, in addition to the"
"customary herb-breakfast, an ill-cooked rabbit. Montgomery followed"
"him. His roving eye caught the position of my arm and he smiled askew."
"The puma was resting to heal that day; but Moreau, who was singularly"
"solitary in his habits, did not join us. I talked with Montgomery to"
"clear my ideas of the way in which the Beast Folk lived. In particular,"
"I was urgent to know how these inhuman monsters were kept from falling"
"upon Moreau and Montgomery and from rending one another. He explained"
"to me that the comparative safety of Moreau and himself was due to the"
"limited mental scope of these monsters. In spite of their increased"
"intelligence and the tendency of their animal instincts to reawaken,"
"they had certain fixed ideas implanted by Moreau in their minds, which"
"absolutely bounded their imaginations. They were really hypnotised; had"
"been told that certain things were impossible, and that certain things"
"were not to be done, and these prohibitions were woven into the texture"
"of their minds beyond any possibility of disobedience or dispute."
"Certain matters, however, in which old instinct was at war with"
"Moreau’s convenience, were in a less stable condition. A series of"
"propositions called the Law (I had already heard them recited) battled"
"in their minds with the deep-seated, ever-rebellious cravings of their"
"animal natures. This Law they were ever repeating, I found, and ever"
"breaking. Both Montgomery and Moreau displayed particular solicitude to"
"keep them ignorant of the taste of blood; they feared the inevitable"
"suggestions of that flavour. Montgomery told me that the Law,"
"especially among the feline Beast People, became oddly weakened about"
"nightfall; that then the animal was at its strongest; that a spirit of"
"adventure sprang up in them at the dusk, when they would dare things"
"they never seemed to dream about by day. To that I owed my stalking by"
"the Leopard-man, on the night of my arrival. But during these earlier"
"days of my stay they broke the Law only furtively and after dark; in"
"the daylight there was a general atmosphere of respect for its"
"multifarious prohibitions."
"And here perhaps I may give a few general facts about the island and"
"the Beast People. The island, which was of irregular outline and lay"
"low upon the wide sea, had a total area, I suppose, of seven or eight"
"square miles.[2] It was volcanic in origin, and was now fringed on"
"three sides by coral reefs; some fumaroles to the northward, and a hot"
"spring, were the only vestiges of the forces that had long since"
"originated it. Now and then a faint quiver of earthquake would be"
"sensible, and sometimes the ascent of the spire of smoke would be"
"rendered tumultuous by gusts of steam; but that was all. The population"
"of the island, Montgomery informed me, now numbered rather more than"
"sixty of these strange creations of Moreau’s art, not counting the"
"smaller monstrosities which lived in the undergrowth and were without"
"human form. Altogether he had made nearly a hundred and twenty; but"
"many had died, and others—like the writhing Footless Thing of which he"
"had told me—had come by violent ends. In answer to my question,"
"Montgomery said that they actually bore offspring, but that these"
"generally died. When they lived, Moreau took them and stamped the human"
"form upon them. There was no evidence of the inheritance of their"
"acquired human characteristics. The females were less numerous than the"
"males, and liable to much furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy"
"the Law enjoined."
" [2]This description corresponds in every respect to Noble’s Isle.—C."
" E. P."
"It would be impossible for me to describe these Beast People in detail;"
"my eye has had no training in details, and unhappily I cannot sketch."
"Most striking, perhaps, in their general appearance was the"
"disproportion between the legs of these creatures and the length of"
"their bodies; and yet—so relative is our idea of grace—my eye became"
"habituated to their forms, and at last I even fell in with their"
"persuasion that my own long thighs were ungainly. Another point was the"
"forward carriage of the head and the clumsy and inhuman curvature of"
"the spine. Even the Ape-man lacked that inward sinuous curve of the"
"back which makes the human figure so graceful. Most had their shoulders"
"hunched clumsily, and their short forearms hung weakly at their sides."
"Few of them were conspicuously hairy, at least until the end of my time"
"upon the island."
"The next most obvious deformity was in their faces, almost all of which"
"were prognathous, malformed about the ears, with large and protuberant"
"noses, very furry or very bristly hair, and often strangely-coloured or"
"strangely-placed eyes. None could laugh, though the Ape-man had a"
"chattering titter. Beyond these general characters their heads had"
"little in common; each preserved the quality of its particular species:"
"the human mark distorted but did not hide the leopard, the ox, or the"
"sow, or other animal or animals, from which the creature had been"
"moulded. The voices, too, varied exceedingly. The hands were always"
"malformed; and though some surprised me by their unexpected human"
"appearance, almost all were deficient in the number of the digits,"
"clumsy about the finger-nails, and lacking any tactile sensibility."
"The two most formidable Animal Men were my Leopard-man and a creature"
"made of hyena and swine. Larger than these were the three"
"bull-creatures who pulled in the boat. Then came the silvery-hairy-man,"
"who was also the Sayer of the Law, M’ling, and a satyr-like creature of"
"ape and goat. There were three Swine-men and a Swine-woman, a"
"mare-rhinoceros-creature, and several other females whose sources I did"
"not ascertain. There were several wolf-creatures, a bear-bull, and a"
"Saint-Bernard-man. I have already described the Ape-man, and there was"
"a particularly hateful (and evil-smelling) old woman made of vixen and"
"bear, whom I hated from the beginning. She was said to be a passionate"
"votary of the Law. Smaller creatures were certain dappled youths and my"
"little sloth-creature. But enough of this catalogue."
"At first I had a shivering horror of the brutes, felt all too keenly"
"that they were still brutes; but insensibly I became a little"
"habituated to the idea of them, and moreover I was affected by"
"Montgomery’s attitude towards them. He had been with them so long that"
"he had come to regard them as almost normal human beings. His London"
"days seemed a glorious, impossible past to him. Only once in a year or"
"so did he go to Arica to deal with Moreau’s agent, a trader in animals"
"there. He hardly met the finest type of mankind in that seafaring"
"village of Spanish mongrels. The men aboard-ship, he told me, seemed at"
"first just as strange to him as the Beast Men seemed to me,—unnaturally"
"long in the leg, flat in the face, prominent in the forehead,"
"suspicious, dangerous, and cold-hearted. In fact, he did not like men:"
"his heart had warmed to me, he thought, because he had saved my life. I"
"fancied even then that he had a sneaking kindness for some of these"
"metamorphosed brutes, a vicious sympathy with some of their ways, but"
"that he attempted to veil it from me at first."
"M’ling, the black-faced man, Montgomery’s attendant, the first of the"
"Beast Folk I had encountered, did not live with the others across the"
"island, but in a small kennel at the back of the enclosure. The"
"creature was scarcely so intelligent as the Ape-man, but far more"
"docile, and the most human-looking of all the Beast Folk; and"
"Montgomery had trained it to prepare food, and indeed to discharge all"
"the trivial domestic offices that were required. It was a complex"
"trophy of Moreau’s horrible skill,—a bear, tainted with dog and ox, and"
"one of the most elaborately made of all his creatures. It treated"
"Montgomery with a strange tenderness and devotion. Sometimes he would"
"notice it, pat it, call it half-mocking, half-jocular names, and so"
"make it caper with extraordinary delight; sometimes he would ill-treat"
"it, especially after he had been at the whiskey, kicking it, beating"
"it, pelting it with stones or lighted fusees. But whether he treated it"
"well or ill, it loved nothing so much as to be near him."
"I say I became habituated to the Beast People, that a thousand things"
"which had seemed unnatural and repulsive speedily became natural and"
"ordinary to me. I suppose everything in existence takes its colour from"
"the average hue of our surroundings. Montgomery and Moreau were too"
"peculiar and individual to keep my general impressions of humanity well"
"defined. I would see one of the clumsy bovine-creatures who worked the"
"launch treading heavily through the undergrowth, and find myself"
"asking, trying hard to recall, how he differed from some really human"
"yokel trudging home from his mechanical labours; or I would meet the"
"Fox-bear woman’s vulpine, shifty face, strangely human in its"
"speculative cunning, and even imagine I had met it before in some city"
"byway."
"Yet every now and then the beast would flash out upon me beyond doubt"
"or denial. An ugly-looking man, a hunch-backed human savage to all"
"appearance, squatting in the aperture of one of the dens, would stretch"
"his arms and yawn, showing with startling suddenness scissor-edged"
"incisors and sabre-like canines, keen and brilliant as knives. Or in"
"some narrow pathway, glancing with a transitory daring into the eyes of"
"some lithe, white-swathed female figure, I would suddenly see (with a"
"spasmodic revulsion) that she had slit-like pupils, or glancing down"
"note the curving nail with which she held her shapeless wrap about her."
"It is a curious thing, by the bye, for which I am quite unable to"
"account, that these weird creatures—the females, I mean—had in the"
"earlier days of my stay an instinctive sense of their own repulsive"
"clumsiness, and displayed in consequence a more than human regard for"
"the decency and decorum of extensive costume."
"XVI."
"HOW THE BEAST FOLK TASTE BLOOD."
"My inexperience as a writer betrays me, and I wander from the thread of"
"my story."
"After I had breakfasted with Montgomery, he took me across the island"
"to see the fumarole and the source of the hot spring into whose"
"scalding waters I had blundered on the previous day. Both of us carried"
"whips and loaded revolvers. While going through a leafy jungle on our"
"road thither, we heard a rabbit squealing. We stopped and listened, but"
"we heard no more; and presently we went on our way, and the incident"
"dropped out of our minds. Montgomery called my attention to certain"
"little pink animals with long hind-legs, that went leaping through the"
"undergrowth. He told me they were creatures made of the offspring of"
"the Beast People, that Moreau had invented. He had fancied they might"
"serve for meat, but a rabbit-like habit of devouring their young had"
"defeated this intention. I had already encountered some of these"
"creatures,—once during my moonlight flight from the Leopard-man, and"
"once during my pursuit by Moreau on the previous day. By chance, one"
"hopping to avoid us leapt into the hole caused by the uprooting of a"
"wind-blown tree; before it could extricate itself we managed to catch"
"it. It spat like a cat, scratched and kicked vigorously with its"
"hind-legs, and made an attempt to bite; but its teeth were too feeble"
"to inflict more than a painless pinch. It seemed to me rather a pretty"
"little creature; and as Montgomery stated that it never destroyed the"
"turf by burrowing, and was very cleanly in its habits, I should imagine"
"it might prove a convenient substitute for the common rabbit in"
"gentlemen’s parks."
"We also saw on our way the trunk of a tree barked in long strips and"
"splintered deeply. Montgomery called my attention to this. “Not to claw"
"bark of trees, _that_ is the Law,” he said. “Much some of them care for"
"it!” It was after this, I think, that we met the Satyr and the Ape-man."
"The Satyr was a gleam of classical memory on the part of Moreau,—his"
"face ovine in expression, like the coarser Hebrew type; his voice a"
"harsh bleat, his nether extremities Satanic. He was gnawing the husk of"
"a pod-like fruit as he passed us. Both of them saluted Montgomery."
"“Hail,” said they, “to the Other with the Whip!”"
"“There’s a Third with a Whip now,” said Montgomery. “So you’d better"
"mind!”"
"“Was he not made?” said the Ape-man. “He said—he said he was made.”"
"The Satyr-man looked curiously at me. “The Third with the Whip, he that"
"walks weeping into the sea, has a thin white face.”"
"“He has a thin long whip,” said Montgomery."
"“Yesterday he bled and wept,” said the Satyr. “You never bleed nor"
"weep. The Master does not bleed or weep.”"
"“Ollendorffian beggar!” said Montgomery, “you’ll bleed and weep if you"
"don’t look out!”"
"“He has five fingers, he is a five-man like me,” said the Ape-man."
"“Come along, Prendick,” said Montgomery, taking my arm; and I went on"
"with him."
"The Satyr and the Ape-man stood watching us and making other remarks to"
"each other."
"“He says nothing,” said the Satyr. “Men have voices.”"
"“Yesterday he asked me of things to eat,” said the Ape-man. “He did not"
"know.”"
"Then they spoke inaudible things, and I heard the Satyr laughing."
"It was on our way back that we came upon the dead rabbit. The red body"
"of the wretched little beast was rent to pieces, many of the ribs"
"stripped white, and the backbone indisputably gnawed."
"At that Montgomery stopped. “Good God!” said he, stooping down, and"
"picking up some of the crushed vertebrae to examine them more closely."
"“Good God!” he repeated, “what can this mean?”"
"“Some carnivore of yours has remembered its old habits,” I said after a"
"pause. “This backbone has been bitten through.”"
"He stood staring, with his face white and his lip pulled askew. “I"
"don’t like this,” he said slowly."
"“I saw something of the same kind,” said I, “the first day I came"
"here.”"
"“The devil you did! What was it?”"
"“A rabbit with its head twisted off.”"
"“The day you came here?”"
"“The day I came here. In the undergrowth at the back of the enclosure,"
"when I went out in the evening. The head was completely wrung off.”"
"He gave a long, low whistle."
"“And what is more, I have an idea which of your brutes did the thing."
"It’s only a suspicion, you know. Before I came on the rabbit I saw one"
"of your monsters drinking in the stream.”"
"“Sucking his drink?”"
"“Yes.”"
"“‘Not to suck your drink; that is the Law.’ Much the brutes care for"
"the Law, eh? when Moreau’s not about!”"
"“It was the brute who chased me.”"
"“Of course,” said Montgomery; “it’s just the way with carnivores. After"
"a kill, they drink. It’s the taste of blood, you know.—What was the"
"brute like?” he continued. “Would you know him again?” He glanced about"
"us, standing astride over the mess of dead rabbit, his eyes roving"
"among the shadows and screens of greenery, the lurking-places and"
"ambuscades of the forest that bounded us in. “The taste of blood,” he"
"said again."
"He took out his revolver, examined the cartridges in it and replaced"
"it. Then he began to pull at his dropping lip."
"“I think I should know the brute again,” I said. “I stunned him. He"
"ought to have a handsome bruise on the forehead of him.”"
"“But then we have to _prove_ that he killed the rabbit,” said"
"Montgomery. “I wish I’d never brought the things here.”"
"I should have gone on, but he stayed there thinking over the mangled"
"rabbit in a puzzle-headed way. As it was, I went to such a distance"
"that the rabbit’s remains were hidden."
"“Come on!” I said."
"Presently he woke up and came towards me. “You see,” he said, almost in"
"a whisper, “they are all supposed to have a fixed idea against eating"
"anything that runs on land. If some brute has by any accident tasted"
"blood—”"
"We went on some way in silence. “I wonder what can have happened,” he"
"said to himself. Then, after a pause again: “I did a foolish thing the"
"other day. That servant of mine—I showed him how to skin and cook a"
"rabbit. It’s odd—I saw him licking his hands—It never occurred to me.”"
"Then: “We must put a stop to this. I must tell Moreau.”"
"He could think of nothing else on our homeward journey."
"Moreau took the matter even more seriously than Montgomery, and I need"
"scarcely say that I was affected by their evident consternation."
"“We must make an example,” said Moreau. “I’ve no doubt in my own mind"
"that the Leopard-man was the sinner. But how can we prove it? I wish,"
"Montgomery, you had kept your taste for meat in hand, and gone without"
"these exciting novelties. We may find ourselves in a mess yet, through"
"it.”"
"“I was a silly ass,” said Montgomery. “But the thing’s done now; and"
"you said I might have them, you know.”"
"“We must see to the thing at once,” said Moreau. “I suppose if anything"
"should turn up, M’ling can take care of himself?”"
"“I’m not so sure of M’ling,” said Montgomery. “I think I ought to know"
"him.”"
"In the afternoon, Moreau, Montgomery, myself, and M’ling went across"
"the island to the huts in the ravine. We three were armed; M’ling"
"carried the little hatchet he used in chopping firewood, and some coils"
"of wire. Moreau had a huge cowherd’s horn slung over his shoulder."
"“You will see a gathering of the Beast People,” said Montgomery. “It is"
"a pretty sight!”"
"Moreau said not a word on the way, but the expression of his heavy,"
"white-fringed face was grimly set."
"We crossed the ravine down which smoked the stream of hot water, and"
"followed the winding pathway through the canebrakes until we reached a"
"wide area covered over with a thick, powdery yellow substance which I"
"believe was sulphur. Above the shoulder of a weedy bank the sea"
"glittered. We came to a kind of shallow natural amphitheatre, and here"
"the four of us halted. Then Moreau sounded the horn, and broke the"
"sleeping stillness of the tropical afternoon. He must have had strong"
"lungs. The hooting note rose and rose amidst its echoes, to at last an"
"ear-penetrating intensity."
"“Ah!” said Moreau, letting the curved instrument fall to his side"
"again."
"Immediately there was a crashing through the yellow canes, and a sound"
"of voices from the dense green jungle that marked the morass through"
"which I had run on the previous day. Then at three or four points on"
"the edge of the sulphurous area appeared the grotesque forms of the"
"Beast People hurrying towards us. I could not help a creeping horror,"
"as I perceived first one and then another trot out from the trees or"
"reeds and come shambling along over the hot dust. But Moreau and"
"Montgomery stood calmly enough; and, perforce, I stuck beside them."
"First to arrive was the Satyr, strangely unreal for all that he cast a"
"shadow and tossed the dust with his hoofs. After him from the brake"
"came a monstrous lout, a thing of horse and rhinoceros, chewing a straw"
"as it came; then appeared the Swine-woman and two Wolf-women; then the"
"Fox-bear witch, with her red eyes in her peaked red face, and then"
"others,—all hurrying eagerly. As they came forward they began to cringe"
"towards Moreau and chant, quite regardless of one another, fragments of"
"the latter half of the litany of the Law,—“His is the Hand that wounds;"
"His is the Hand that heals,” and so forth. As soon as they had"
"approached within a distance of perhaps thirty yards they halted, and"
"bowing on knees and elbows began flinging the white dust upon their"
"heads."
"Imagine the scene if you can! We three blue-clad men, with our"
"misshapen black-faced attendant, standing in a wide expanse of sunlit"
"yellow dust under the blazing blue sky, and surrounded by this circle"
"of crouching and gesticulating monstrosities,—some almost human save in"
"their subtle expression and gestures, some like cripples, some so"
"strangely distorted as to resemble nothing but the denizens of our"
"wildest dreams; and, beyond, the reedy lines of a canebrake in one"
"direction, a dense tangle of palm-trees on the other, separating us"
"from the ravine with the huts, and to the north the hazy horizon of the"
"Pacific Ocean."
"“Sixty-two, sixty-three,” counted Moreau. “There are four more.”"
"“I do not see the Leopard-man,” said I."
"Presently Moreau sounded the great horn again, and at the sound of it"
"all the Beast People writhed and grovelled in the dust. Then, slinking"
"out of the canebrake, stooping near the ground and trying to join the"
"dust-throwing circle behind Moreau’s back, came the Leopard-man. The"
"last of the Beast People to arrive was the little Ape-man. The earlier"
"animals, hot and weary with their grovelling, shot vicious glances at"
"him."
"“Cease!” said Moreau, in his firm, loud voice; and the Beast People sat"
"back upon their hams and rested from their worshipping."
"“Where is the Sayer of the Law?” said Moreau, and the hairy-grey"
"monster bowed his face in the dust."
"“Say the words!” said Moreau."
"Forthwith all in the kneeling assembly, swaying from side to side and"
"dashing up the sulphur with their hands,—first the right hand and a"
"puff of dust, and then the left,—began once more to chant their strange"
"litany. When they reached, “Not to eat Flesh or Fish, that is the Law,”"
"Moreau held up his lank white hand."
"“Stop!” he cried, and there fell absolute silence upon them all."
"I think they all knew and dreaded what was coming. I looked round at"
"their strange faces. When I saw their wincing attitudes and the furtive"
"dread in their bright eyes, I wondered that I had ever believed them to"
"be men."
"“That Law has been broken!” said Moreau."
"“None escape,” from the faceless creature with the silvery hair. “None"
"escape,” repeated the kneeling circle of Beast People."
"“Who is he?” cried Moreau, and looked round at their faces, cracking"
"his whip. I fancied the Hyena-swine looked dejected, so too did the"
"Leopard-man. Moreau stopped, facing this creature, who cringed towards"
"him with the memory and dread of infinite torment."
"“Who is he?” repeated Moreau, in a voice of thunder."
"“Evil is he who breaks the Law,” chanted the Sayer of the Law."
"Moreau looked into the eyes of the Leopard-man, and seemed to be"
"dragging the very soul out of the creature."
"“Who breaks the Law—” said Moreau, taking his eyes off his victim, and"
"turning towards us (it seemed to me there was a touch of exultation in"
"his voice)."
"“Goes back to the House of Pain,” they all clamoured,—“goes back to the"
"House of Pain, O Master!”"
"“Back to the House of Pain,—back to the House of Pain,” gabbled the"
"Ape-man, as though the idea was sweet to him."
"“Do you hear?” said Moreau, turning back to the criminal, “my"
"friend—Hullo!”"
"For the Leopard-man, released from Moreau’s eye, had risen straight"
"from his knees, and now, with eyes aflame and his huge feline tusks"
"flashing out from under his curling lips, leapt towards his tormentor."
"I am convinced that only the madness of unendurable fear could have"
"prompted this attack. The whole circle of threescore monsters seemed to"
"rise about us. I drew my revolver. The two figures collided. I saw"
"Moreau reeling back from the Leopard-man’s blow. There was a furious"
"yelling and howling all about us. Every one was moving rapidly. For a"
"moment I thought it was a general revolt. The furious face of the"
"Leopard-man flashed by mine, with M’ling close in pursuit. I saw the"
"yellow eyes of the Hyena-swine blazing with excitement, his attitude as"
"if he were half resolved to attack me. The Satyr, too, glared at me"
"over the Hyena-swine’s hunched shoulders. I heard the crack of Moreau’s"
"pistol, and saw the pink flash dart across the tumult. The whole crowd"
"seemed to swing round in the direction of the glint of fire, and I too"
"was swung round by the magnetism of the movement. In another second I"
"was running, one of a tumultuous shouting crowd, in pursuit of the"
"escaping Leopard-man."
"That is all I can tell definitely. I saw the Leopard-man strike Moreau,"
"and then everything spun about me until I was running headlong. M’ling"
"was ahead, close in pursuit of the fugitive. Behind, their tongues"
"already lolling out, ran the Wolf-women in great leaping strides. The"
"Swine folk followed, squealing with excitement, and the two Bull-men in"
"their swathings of white. Then came Moreau in a cluster of the Beast"
"People, his wide-brimmed straw hat blown off, his revolver in hand, and"
"his lank white hair streaming out. The Hyena-swine ran beside me,"
"keeping pace with me and glancing furtively at me out of his feline"
"eyes, and the others came pattering and shouting behind us."
"The Leopard-man went bursting his way through the long canes, which"
"sprang back as he passed, and rattled in M’ling’s face. We others in"
"the rear found a trampled path for us when we reached the brake. The"
"chase lay through the brake for perhaps a quarter of a mile, and then"
"plunged into a dense thicket, which retarded our movements exceedingly,"
"though we went through it in a crowd together,—fronds flicking into our"
"faces, ropy creepers catching us under the chin or gripping our ankles,"
"thorny plants hooking into and tearing cloth and flesh together."
"“He has gone on all-fours through this,” panted Moreau, now just ahead"
"of me."
"“None escape,” said the Wolf-bear, laughing into my face with the"
"exultation of hunting. We burst out again among rocks, and saw the"
"quarry ahead running lightly on all-fours and snarling at us over his"
"shoulder. At that the Wolf Folk howled with delight. The Thing was"
"still clothed, and at a distance its face still seemed human; but the"
"carriage of its four limbs was feline, and the furtive droop of its"
"shoulder was distinctly that of a hunted animal. It leapt over some"
"thorny yellow-flowering bushes, and was hidden. M’ling was halfway"
"across the space."
"Most of us now had lost the first speed of the chase, and had fallen"
"into a longer and steadier stride. I saw as we traversed the open that"
"the pursuit was now spreading from a column into a line. The"
"Hyena-swine still ran close to me, watching me as it ran, every now and"
"then puckering its muzzle with a snarling laugh. At the edge of the"
"rocks the Leopard-man, realising that he was making for the projecting"
"cape upon which he had stalked me on the night of my arrival, had"
"doubled in the undergrowth; but Montgomery had seen the manoeuvre, and"
"turned him again. So, panting, tumbling against rocks, torn by"
"brambles, impeded by ferns and reeds, I helped to pursue the"
"Leopard-man who had broken the Law, and the Hyena-swine ran, laughing"
"savagely, by my side. I staggered on, my head reeling and my heart"
"beating against my ribs, tired almost to death, and yet not daring to"
"lose sight of the chase lest I should be left alone with this horrible"
"companion. I staggered on in spite of infinite fatigue and the dense"
"heat of the tropical afternoon."
"At last the fury of the hunt slackened. We had pinned the wretched"
"brute into a corner of the island. Moreau, whip in hand, marshalled us"
"all into an irregular line, and we advanced now slowly, shouting to one"
"another as we advanced and tightening the cordon about our victim. He"
"lurked noiseless and invisible in the bushes through which I had run"
"from him during that midnight pursuit."
"“Steady!” cried Moreau, “steady!” as the ends of the line crept round"
"the tangle of undergrowth and hemmed the brute in."
"“Ware a rush!” came the voice of Montgomery from beyond the thicket."
"I was on the slope above the bushes; Montgomery and Moreau beat along"
"the beach beneath. Slowly we pushed in among the fretted network of"
"branches and leaves. The quarry was silent."
"“Back to the House of Pain, the House of Pain, the House of Pain!”"
"yelped the voice of the Ape-man, some twenty yards to the right."
"When I heard that, I forgave the poor wretch all the fear he had"
"inspired in me. I heard the twigs snap and the boughs swish aside"
"before the heavy tread of the Horse-rhinoceros upon my right. Then"
"suddenly through a polygon of green, in the half darkness under the"
"luxuriant growth, I saw the creature we were hunting. I halted. He was"
"crouched together into the smallest possible compass, his luminous"
"green eyes turned over his shoulder regarding me."
"It may seem a strange contradiction in me,—I cannot explain the"
"fact,—but now, seeing the creature there in a perfectly animal"
"attitude, with the light gleaming in its eyes and its imperfectly human"
"face distorted with terror, I realised again the fact of its humanity."
"In another moment other of its pursuers would see it, and it would be"
"overpowered and captured, to experience once more the horrible tortures"
"of the enclosure. Abruptly I slipped out my revolver, aimed between its"
"terror-struck eyes, and fired. As I did so, the Hyena-swine saw the"
"Thing, and flung itself upon it with an eager cry, thrusting thirsty"
"teeth into its neck. All about me the green masses of the thicket were"
"swaying and cracking as the Beast People came rushing together. One"
"face and then another appeared."
"“Don’t kill it, Prendick!” cried Moreau. “Don’t kill it!” and I saw him"
"stooping as he pushed through under the fronds of the big ferns."
"In another moment he had beaten off the Hyena-swine with the handle of"
"his whip, and he and Montgomery were keeping away the excited"
"carnivorous Beast People, and particularly M’ling, from the still"
"quivering body. The hairy-grey Thing came sniffing at the corpse under"
"my arm. The other animals, in their animal ardour, jostled me to get a"
"nearer view."
"“Confound you, Prendick!” said Moreau. “I wanted him.”"
"“I’m sorry,” said I, though I was not. “It was the impulse of the"
"moment.” I felt sick with exertion and excitement. Turning, I pushed my"
"way out of the crowding Beast People and went on alone up the slope"
"towards the higher part of the headland. Under the shouted directions"
"of Moreau I heard the three white-swathed Bull-men begin dragging the"
"victim down towards the water."
"It was easy now for me to be alone. The Beast People manifested a quite"
"human curiosity about the dead body, and followed it in a thick knot,"
"sniffing and growling at it as the Bull-men dragged it down the beach."
"I went to the headland and watched the bull-men, black against the"
"evening sky as they carried the weighted dead body out to sea; and like"
"a wave across my mind came the realisation of the unspeakable"
"aimlessness of things upon the island. Upon the beach among the rocks"
"beneath me were the Ape-man, the Hyena-swine, and several other of the"
"Beast People, standing about Montgomery and Moreau. They were all still"
"intensely excited, and all overflowing with noisy expressions of their"
"loyalty to the Law; yet I felt an absolute assurance in my own mind"
"that the Hyena-swine was implicated in the rabbit-killing. A strange"
"persuasion came upon me, that, save for the grossness of the line, the"
"grotesqueness of the forms, I had here before me the whole balance of"
"human life in miniature, the whole interplay of instinct, reason, and"
"fate in its simplest form. The Leopard-man had happened to go under:"
"that was all the difference. Poor brute!"
"Poor brutes! I began to see the viler aspect of Moreau’s cruelty. I had"
"not thought before of the pain and trouble that came to these poor"
"victims after they had passed from Moreau’s hands. I had shivered only"
"at the days of actual torment in the enclosure. But now that seemed to"
"me the lesser part. Before, they had been beasts, their instincts fitly"
"adapted to their surroundings, and happy as living things may be. Now"
"they stumbled in the shackles of humanity, lived in a fear that never"
"died, fretted by a law they could not understand; their mock-human"
"existence, begun in an agony, was one long internal struggle, one long"
"dread of Moreau—and for what? It was the wantonness of it that stirred"
"me."
"Had Moreau had any intelligible object, I could have sympathised at"
"least a little with him. I am not so squeamish about pain as that. I"
"could have forgiven him a little even, had his motive been only hate."
"But he was so irresponsible, so utterly careless! His curiosity, his"
"mad, aimless investigations, drove him on; and the Things were thrown"
"out to live a year or so, to struggle and blunder and suffer, and at"
"last to die painfully. They were wretched in themselves; the old animal"
"hate moved them to trouble one another; the Law held them back from a"
"brief hot struggle and a decisive end to their natural animosities."
"In those days my fear of the Beast People went the way of my personal"
"fear for Moreau. I fell indeed into a morbid state, deep and enduring,"
"and alien to fear, which has left permanent scars upon my mind. I must"
"confess that I lost faith in the sanity of the world when I saw it"
"suffering the painful disorder of this island. A blind Fate, a vast"
"pitiless mechanism, seemed to cut and shape the fabric of existence and"
"I, Moreau (by his passion for research), Montgomery (by his passion for"
"drink), the Beast People with their instincts and mental restrictions,"
"were torn and crushed, ruthlessly, inevitably, amid the infinite"
"complexity of its incessant wheels. But this condition did not come all"
"at once: I think indeed that I anticipate a little in speaking of it"
"now."
"XVII."
"A CATASTROPHE."
"Scarcely six weeks passed before I had lost every feeling but dislike"
"and abhorrence for this infamous experiment of Moreau’s. My one idea"
"was to get away from these horrible caricatures of my Maker’s image,"
"back to the sweet and wholesome intercourse of men. My"
"fellow-creatures, from whom I was thus separated, began to assume"
"idyllic virtue and beauty in my memory. My first friendship with"
"Montgomery did not increase. His long separation from humanity, his"
"secret vice of drunkenness, his evident sympathy with the Beast People,"
"tainted him to me. Several times I let him go alone among them. I"
"avoided intercourse with them in every possible way. I spent an"
"increasing proportion of my time upon the beach, looking for some"
"liberating sail that never appeared,—until one day there fell upon us"
"an appalling disaster, which put an altogether different aspect upon my"
"strange surroundings."
"It was about seven or eight weeks after my landing,—rather more, I"
"think, though I had not troubled to keep account of the time,—when this"
"catastrophe occurred. It happened in the early morning—I should think"
"about six. I had risen and breakfasted early, having been aroused by"
"the noise of three Beast Men carrying wood into the enclosure."
"After breakfast I went to the open gateway of the enclosure, and stood"
"there smoking a cigarette and enjoying the freshness of the early"
"morning. Moreau presently came round the corner of the enclosure and"
"greeted me. He passed by me, and I heard him behind me unlock and enter"
"his laboratory. So indurated was I at that time to the abomination of"
"the place, that I heard without a touch of emotion the puma victim"
"begin another day of torture. It met its persecutor with a shriek,"
"almost exactly like that of an angry virago."
"Then suddenly something happened,—I do not know what, to this day. I"
"heard a short, sharp cry behind me, a fall, and turning saw an awful"
"face rushing upon me,—not human, not animal, but hellish, brown, seamed"
"with red branching scars, red drops starting out upon it, and the"
"lidless eyes ablaze. I threw up my arm to defend myself from the blow"
"that flung me headlong with a broken forearm; and the great monster,"
"swathed in lint and with red-stained bandages fluttering about it,"
"leapt over me and passed. I rolled over and over down the beach, tried"
"to sit up, and collapsed upon my broken arm. Then Moreau appeared, his"
"massive white face all the more terrible for the blood that trickled"
"from his forehead. He carried a revolver in one hand. He scarcely"
"glanced at me, but rushed off at once in pursuit of the puma."
"I tried the other arm and sat up. The muffled figure in front ran in"
"great striding leaps along the beach, and Moreau followed her. She"
"turned her head and saw him, then doubling abruptly made for the"
"bushes. She gained upon him at every stride. I saw her plunge into"
"them, and Moreau, running slantingly to intercept her, fired and missed"
"as she disappeared. Then he too vanished in the green confusion. I"
"stared after them, and then the pain in my arm flamed up, and with a"
"groan I staggered to my feet. Montgomery appeared in the doorway,"
"dressed, and with his revolver in his hand."
"“Great God, Prendick!” he said, not noticing that I was hurt, “that"
"brute’s loose! Tore the fetter out of the wall! Have you seen them?”"
"Then sharply, seeing I gripped my arm, “What’s the matter?”"
"“I was standing in the doorway,” said I."
"He came forward and took my arm. “Blood on the sleeve,” said he, and"
"rolled back the flannel. He pocketed his weapon, felt my arm about"
"painfully, and led me inside. “Your arm is broken,” he said, and then,"
"“Tell me exactly how it happened—what happened?”"
"I told him what I had seen; told him in broken sentences, with gasps of"
"pain between them, and very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm"
"meanwhile. He slung it from my shoulder, stood back and looked at me."
"“You’ll do,” he said. “And now?”"
"He thought. Then he went out and locked the gates of the enclosure. He"
"was absent some time."
"I was chiefly concerned about my arm. The incident seemed merely one"
"more of many horrible things. I sat down in the deck chair, and I must"
"admit swore heartily at the island. The first dull feeling of injury in"
"my arm had already given way to a burning pain when Montgomery"
"reappeared. His face was rather pale, and he showed more of his lower"
"gums than ever."
"“I can neither see nor hear anything of him,” he said. “I’ve been"
"thinking he may want my help.” He stared at me with his expressionless"
"eyes. “That was a strong brute,” he said. “It simply wrenched its"
"fetter out of the wall.” He went to the window, then to the door, and"
"there turned to me. “I shall go after him,” he said. “There’s another"
"revolver I can leave with you. To tell you the truth, I feel anxious"
"somehow.”"
"He obtained the weapon, and put it ready to my hand on the table; then"
"went out, leaving a restless contagion in the air. I did not sit long"
"after he left, but took the revolver in hand and went to the doorway."
"The morning was as still as death. Not a whisper of wind was stirring;"
"the sea was like polished glass, the sky empty, the beach desolate. In"
"my half-excited, half-feverish state, this stillness of things"
"oppressed me. I tried to whistle, and the tune died away. I swore"
"again,—the second time that morning. Then I went to the corner of the"
"enclosure and stared inland at the green bush that had swallowed up"
"Moreau and Montgomery. When would they return, and how? Then far away"
"up the beach a little grey Beast Man appeared, ran down to the water’s"
"edge and began splashing about. I strolled back to the doorway, then to"
"the corner again, and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel upon"
"duty. Once I was arrested by the distant voice of Montgomery bawling,"
"“Coo-ee—Moreau!” My arm became less painful, but very hot. I got"
"feverish and thirsty. My shadow grew shorter. I watched the distant"
"figure until it went away again. Would Moreau and Montgomery never"
"return? Three sea-birds began fighting for some stranded treasure."
"Then from far away behind the enclosure I heard a pistol-shot. A long"
"silence, and then came another. Then a yelling cry nearer, and another"
"dismal gap of silence. My unfortunate imagination set to work to"
"torment me. Then suddenly a shot close by. I went to the corner,"
"startled, and saw Montgomery,—his face scarlet, his hair disordered,"
"and the knee of his trousers torn. His face expressed profound"
"consternation. Behind him slouched the Beast Man, M’ling, and round"
"M’ling’s jaws were some queer dark stains."
"“Has he come?” said Montgomery."
"“Moreau?” said I. “No.”"
"“My God!” The man was panting, almost sobbing. “Go back in,” he said,"
"taking my arm. “They’re mad. They’re all rushing about mad. What can"
"have happened? I don’t know. I’ll tell you, when my breath comes."
"Where’s some brandy?”"
"Montgomery limped before me into the room and sat down in the deck"
"chair. M’ling flung himself down just outside the doorway and began"
"panting like a dog. I got Montgomery some brandy-and-water. He sat"
"staring in front of him at nothing, recovering his breath. After some"
"minutes he began to tell me what had happened."
"He had followed their track for some way. It was plain enough at first"
"on account of the crushed and broken bushes, white rags torn from the"
"puma’s bandages, and occasional smears of blood on the leaves of the"
"shrubs and undergrowth. He lost the track, however, on the stony ground"
"beyond the stream where I had seen the Beast Man drinking, and went"
"wandering aimlessly westward shouting Moreau’s name. Then M’ling had"
"come to him carrying a light hatchet. M’ling had seen nothing of the"
"puma affair; had been felling wood, and heard him calling. They went on"
"shouting together. Two Beast Men came crouching and peering at them"
"through the undergrowth, with gestures and a furtive carriage that"
"alarmed Montgomery by their strangeness. He hailed them, and they fled"
"guiltily. He stopped shouting after that, and after wandering some time"
"farther in an undecided way, determined to visit the huts."
"He found the ravine deserted."
"Growing more alarmed every minute, he began to retrace his steps. Then"
"it was he encountered the two Swine-men I had seen dancing on the night"
"of my arrival; blood-stained they were about the mouth, and intensely"
"excited. They came crashing through the ferns, and stopped with fierce"
"faces when they saw him. He cracked his whip in some trepidation, and"
"forthwith they rushed at him. Never before had a Beast Man dared to do"
"that. One he shot through the head; M’ling flung himself upon the"
"other, and the two rolled grappling. M’ling got his brute under and"
"with his teeth in its throat, and Montgomery shot that too as it"
"struggled in M’ling’s grip. He had some difficulty in inducing M’ling"
"to come on with him. Thence they had hurried back to me. On the way,"
"M’ling had suddenly rushed into a thicket and driven out an under-sized"
"Ocelot-man, also blood-stained, and lame through a wound in the foot."
"This brute had run a little way and then turned savagely at bay, and"
"Montgomery—with a certain wantonness, I thought—had shot him."
"“What does it all mean?” said I."
"He shook his head, and turned once more to the brandy."
"XVIII."
"THE FINDING OF MOREAU."
"When I saw Montgomery swallow a third dose of brandy, I took it upon"
"myself to interfere. He was already more than half fuddled. I told him"
"that some serious thing must have happened to Moreau by this time, or"
"he would have returned before this, and that it behoved us to ascertain"
"what that catastrophe was. Montgomery raised some feeble objections,"
"and at last agreed. We had some food, and then all three of us started."
"It is possibly due to the tension of my mind, at the time, but even now"
"that start into the hot stillness of the tropical afternoon is a"
"singularly vivid impression. M’ling went first, his shoulder hunched,"
"his strange black head moving with quick starts as he peered first on"
"this side of the way and then on that. He was unarmed; his axe he had"
"dropped when he encountered the Swine-man. Teeth were _his_ weapons,"
"when it came to fighting. Montgomery followed with stumbling footsteps,"
"his hands in his pockets, his face downcast; he was in a state of"
"muddled sullenness with me on account of the brandy. My left arm was in"
"a sling (it was lucky it was my left), and I carried my revolver in my"
"right. Soon we traced a narrow path through the wild luxuriance of the"
"island, going northwestward; and presently M’ling stopped, and became"
"rigid with watchfulness. Montgomery almost staggered into him, and then"
"stopped too. Then, listening intently, we heard coming through the"
"trees the sound of voices and footsteps approaching us."
"“He is dead,” said a deep, vibrating voice."
"“He is not dead; he is not dead,” jabbered another."
"“We saw, we saw,” said several voices."
"“_Hul_-lo!” suddenly shouted Montgomery, “Hullo, there!”"
"“Confound you!” said I, and gripped my pistol."
"There was a silence, then a crashing among the interlacing vegetation,"
"first here, then there, and then half-a-dozen faces appeared,—strange"
"faces, lit by a strange light. M’ling made a growling noise in his"
"throat. I recognised the Ape-man: I had indeed already identified his"
"voice, and two of the white-swathed brown-featured creatures I had seen"
"in Montgomery’s boat. With these were the two dappled brutes and that"
"grey, horribly crooked creature who said the Law, with grey hair"
"streaming down its cheeks, heavy grey eyebrows, and grey locks pouring"
"off from a central parting upon its sloping forehead,—a heavy, faceless"
"thing, with strange red eyes, looking at us curiously from amidst the"
"green."
"For a space no one spoke. Then Montgomery hiccoughed, “Who—said he was"
"dead?”"
"The Monkey-man looked guiltily at the hairy-grey Thing. “He is dead,”"
"said this monster. “They saw.”"
"There was nothing threatening about this detachment, at any rate. They"
"seemed awestricken and puzzled."
"“Where is he?” said Montgomery."
"“Beyond,” and the grey creature pointed."
"“Is there a Law now?” asked the Monkey-man. “Is it still to be this and"
"that? Is he dead indeed?”"
"“Is there a Law?” repeated the man in white. “Is there a Law, thou"
"Other with the Whip?”"
"“He is dead,” said the hairy-grey Thing. And they all stood watching"
"us."
"“Prendick,” said Montgomery, turning his dull eyes to me. “He’s dead,"
"evidently.”"
"I had been standing behind him during this colloquy. I began to see how"
"things lay with them. I suddenly stepped in front of Montgomery and"
"lifted up my voice:—“Children of the Law,” I said, “he is _not_ dead!”"
"M’ling turned his sharp eyes on me. “He has changed his shape; he has"
"changed his body,” I went on. “For a time you will not see him. He"
"is—there,” I pointed upward, “where he can watch you. You cannot see"
"him, but he can see you. Fear the Law!”"
"I looked at them squarely. They flinched."
"“He is great, he is good,” said the Ape-man, peering fearfully upward"
"among the dense trees."
"“And the other Thing?” I demanded."
"“The Thing that bled, and ran screaming and sobbing,—that is dead too,”"
"said the grey Thing, still regarding me."
"“That’s well,” grunted Montgomery."
"“The Other with the Whip—” began the grey Thing."
"“Well?” said I."
"“Said he was dead.”"
"But Montgomery was still sober enough to understand my motive in"
"denying Moreau’s death. “He is not dead,” he said slowly, “not dead at"
"all. No more dead than I am.”"
"“Some,” said I, “have broken the Law: they will die. Some have died."
"Show us now where his old body lies,—the body he cast away because he"
"had no more need of it.”"
"“It is this way, Man who walked in the Sea,” said the grey Thing."
"And with these six creatures guiding us, we went through the tumult of"
"ferns and creepers and tree-stems towards the northwest. Then came a"
"yelling, a crashing among the branches, and a little pink homunculus"
"rushed by us shrieking. Immediately after appeared a monster in"
"headlong pursuit, blood-bedabbled, who was amongst us almost before he"
"could stop his career. The grey Thing leapt aside. M’ling, with a"
"snarl, flew at it, and was struck aside. Montgomery fired and missed,"
"bowed his head, threw up his arm, and turned to run. I fired, and the"
"Thing still came on; fired again, point-blank, into its ugly face. I"
"saw its features vanish in a flash: its face was driven in. Yet it"
"passed me, gripped Montgomery, and holding him, fell headlong beside"
"him and pulled him sprawling upon itself in its death-agony."
"I found myself alone with M’ling, the dead brute, and the prostrate"
"man. Montgomery raised himself slowly and stared in a muddled way at"
"the shattered Beast Man beside him. It more than half sobered him. He"
"scrambled to his feet. Then I saw the grey Thing returning cautiously"
"through the trees."
"“See,” said I, pointing to the dead brute, “is the Law not alive? This"
"came of breaking the Law.”"
"He peered at the body. “He sends the Fire that kills,” said he, in his"
"deep voice, repeating part of the Ritual. The others gathered round and"
"stared for a space."
"At last we drew near the westward extremity of the island. We came upon"
"the gnawed and mutilated body of the puma, its shoulder-bone smashed by"
"a bullet, and perhaps twenty yards farther found at last what we"
"sought. Moreau lay face downward in a trampled space in a canebrake."
"One hand was almost severed at the wrist and his silvery hair was"
"dabbled in blood. His head had been battered in by the fetters of the"
"puma. The broken canes beneath him were smeared with blood. His"
"revolver we could not find. Montgomery turned him over. Resting at"
"intervals, and with the help of the seven Beast People (for he was a"
"heavy man), we carried Moreau back to the enclosure. The night was"
"darkling. Twice we heard unseen creatures howling and shrieking past"
"our little band, and once the little pink sloth-creature appeared and"
"stared at us, and vanished again. But we were not attacked again. At"
"the gates of the enclosure our company of Beast People left us, M’ling"
"going with the rest. We locked ourselves in, and then took Moreau’s"
"mangled body into the yard and laid it upon a pile of brushwood. Then"
"we went into the laboratory and put an end to all we found living"
"there."
"XIX."
"MONTGOMERY’S “BANK HOLIDAY.”"
"When this was accomplished, and we had washed and eaten, Montgomery and"
"I went into my little room and seriously discussed our position for the"
"first time. It was then near midnight. He was almost sober, but greatly"
"disturbed in his mind. He had been strangely under the influence of"
"Moreau’s personality: I do not think it had ever occurred to him that"
"Moreau could die. This disaster was the sudden collapse of the habits"
"that had become part of his nature in the ten or more monotonous years"
"he had spent on the island. He talked vaguely, answered my questions"
"crookedly, wandered into general questions."
"“This silly ass of a world,” he said; “what a muddle it all is! I"
"haven’t had any life. I wonder when it’s going to begin. Sixteen years"
"being bullied by nurses and schoolmasters at their own sweet will; five"
"in London grinding hard at medicine, bad food, shabby lodgings, shabby"
"clothes, shabby vice, a blunder,—_I_ didn’t know any better,—and"
"hustled off to this beastly island. Ten years here! What’s it all for,"
"Prendick? Are we bubbles blown by a baby?”"
"It was hard to deal with such ravings. “The thing we have to think of"
"now,” said I, “is how to get away from this island.”"
"“What’s the good of getting away? I’m an outcast. Where am _I_ to join"
"on? It’s all very well for _you_, Prendick. Poor old Moreau! We can’t"
"leave him here to have his bones picked. As it is—And besides, what"
"will become of the decent part of the Beast Folk?”"
"“Well,” said I, “that will do to-morrow. I’ve been thinking we might"
"make the brushwood into a pyre and burn his body—and those other"
"things. Then what will happen with the Beast Folk?”"
"“_I_ don’t know. I suppose those that were made of beasts of prey will"
"make silly asses of themselves sooner or later. We can’t massacre the"
"lot—can we? I suppose that’s what _your_ humanity would suggest? But"
"they’ll change. They are sure to change.”"
"He talked thus inconclusively until at last I felt my temper going."
"“Damnation!” he exclaimed at some petulance of mine; “can’t you see I’m"
"in a worse hole than you are?” And he got up, and went for the brandy."
"“Drink!” he said returning, “you logic-chopping, chalky-faced saint of"
"an atheist, drink!”"
"“Not I,” said I, and sat grimly watching his face under the yellow"
"paraffine flare, as he drank himself into a garrulous misery."
"I have a memory of infinite tedium. He wandered into a maudlin defence"
"of the Beast People and of M’ling. M’ling, he said, was the only thing"
"that had ever really cared for him. And suddenly an idea came to him."
"“I’m damned!” said he, staggering to his feet and clutching the brandy"
"bottle."
"By some flash of intuition I knew what it was he intended. “You don’t"
"give drink to that beast!” I said, rising and facing him."
"“Beast!” said he. “You’re the beast. He takes his liquor like a"
"Christian. Come out of the way, Prendick!”"
"“For God’s sake,” said I."
"“Get—out of the way!” he roared, and suddenly whipped out his revolver."
"“Very well,” said I, and stood aside, half-minded to fall upon him as"
"he put his hand upon the latch, but deterred by the thought of my"
"useless arm. “You’ve made a beast of yourself,—to the beasts you may"
"go.”"
"He flung the doorway open, and stood half facing me between the yellow"
"lamp-light and the pallid glare of the moon; his eye-sockets were"
"blotches of black under his stubbly eyebrows."
"“You’re a solemn prig, Prendick, a silly ass! You’re always fearing and"
"fancying. We’re on the edge of things. I’m bound to cut my throat"
"to-morrow. I’m going to have a damned Bank Holiday to-night.” He turned"
"and went out into the moonlight. “M’ling!” he cried; “M’ling, old"
"friend!”"
"Three dim creatures in the silvery light came along the edge of the wan"
"beach,—one a white-wrapped creature, the other two blotches of"
"blackness following it. They halted, staring. Then I saw M’ling’s"
"hunched shoulders as he came round the corner of the house."
"“Drink!” cried Montgomery, “drink, you brutes! Drink and be men! Damme,"
"I’m the cleverest. Moreau forgot this; this is the last touch. Drink, I"
"tell you!” And waving the bottle in his hand he started off at a kind"
"of quick trot to the westward, M’ling ranging himself between him and"
"the three dim creatures who followed."
"I went to the doorway. They were already indistinct in the mist of the"
"moonlight before Montgomery halted. I saw him administer a dose of the"
"raw brandy to M’ling, and saw the five figures melt into one vague"
"patch."
"“Sing!” I heard Montgomery shout,—“sing all together, ‘Confound old"
"Prendick!’ That’s right; now again, ‘Confound old Prendick!’”"
"The black group broke up into five separate figures, and wound slowly"
"away from me along the band of shining beach. Each went howling at his"
"own sweet will, yelping insults at me, or giving whatever other vent"
"this new inspiration of brandy demanded. Presently I heard Montgomery’s"
"voice shouting, “Right turn!” and they passed with their shouts and"
"howls into the blackness of the landward trees. Slowly, very slowly,"
"they receded into silence."
"The peaceful splendour of the night healed again. The moon was now past"
"the meridian and travelling down the west. It was at its full, and very"
"bright riding through the empty blue sky. The shadow of the wall lay, a"
"yard wide and of inky blackness, at my feet. The eastward sea was a"
"featureless grey, dark and mysterious; and between the sea and the"
"shadow the grey sands (of volcanic glass and crystals) flashed and"
"shone like a beach of diamonds. Behind me the paraffine lamp flared hot"
"and ruddy."
"Then I shut the door, locked it, and went into the enclosure where"
"Moreau lay beside his latest victims,—the staghounds and the llama and"
"some other wretched brutes,—with his massive face calm even after his"
"terrible death, and with the hard eyes open, staring at the dead white"
"moon above. I sat down upon the edge of the sink, and with my eyes upon"
"that ghastly pile of silvery light and ominous shadows began to turn"
"over my plans. In the morning I would gather some provisions in the"
"dingey, and after setting fire to the pyre before me, push out into the"
"desolation of the high sea once more. I felt that for Montgomery there"
"was no help; that he was, in truth, half akin to these Beast Folk,"
"unfitted for human kindred."
"I do not know how long I sat there scheming. It must have been an hour"
"or so. Then my planning was interrupted by the return of Montgomery to"
"my neighbourhood. I heard a yelling from many throats, a tumult of"
"exultant cries passing down towards the beach, whooping and howling,"
"and excited shrieks that seemed to come to a stop near the water’s"
"edge. The riot rose and fell; I heard heavy blows and the splintering"
"smash of wood, but it did not trouble me then. A discordant chanting"
"began."
"My thoughts went back to my means of escape. I got up, brought the"
"lamp, and went into a shed to look at some kegs I had seen there. Then"
"I became interested in the contents of some biscuit-tins, and opened"
"one. I saw something out of the tail of my eye,—a red figure,—and"
"turned sharply."
"Behind me lay the yard, vividly black-and-white in the moonlight, and"
"the pile of wood and faggots on which Moreau and his mutilated victims"
"lay, one over another. They seemed to be gripping one another in one"
"last revengeful grapple. His wounds gaped, black as night, and the"
"blood that had dripped lay in black patches upon the sand. Then I saw,"
"without understanding, the cause of my phantom,—a ruddy glow that came"
"and danced and went upon the wall opposite. I misinterpreted this,"
"fancied it was a reflection of my flickering lamp, and turned again to"
"the stores in the shed. I went on rummaging among them, as well as a"
"one-armed man could, finding this convenient thing and that, and"
"putting them aside for to-morrow’s launch. My movements were slow, and"
"the time passed quickly. Insensibly the daylight crept upon me."
"The chanting died down, giving place to a clamour; then it began again,"
"and suddenly broke into a tumult. I heard cries of, “More! more!” a"
"sound like quarrelling, and a sudden wild shriek. The quality of the"
"sounds changed so greatly that it arrested my attention. I went out"
"into the yard and listened. Then cutting like a knife across the"
"confusion came the crack of a revolver."
"I rushed at once through my room to the little doorway. As I did so I"
"heard some of the packing-cases behind me go sliding down and smash"
"together with a clatter of glass on the floor of the shed. But I did"
"not heed these. I flung the door open and looked out."
"Up the beach by the boathouse a bonfire was burning, raining up sparks"
"into the indistinctness of the dawn. Around this struggled a mass of"
"black figures. I heard Montgomery call my name. I began to run at once"
"towards this fire, revolver in hand. I saw the pink tongue of"
"Montgomery’s pistol lick out once, close to the ground. He was down. I"
"shouted with all my strength and fired into the air. I heard some one"
"cry, “The Master!” The knotted black struggle broke into scattering"
"units, the fire leapt and sank down. The crowd of Beast People fled in"
"sudden panic before me, up the beach. In my excitement I fired at their"
"retreating backs as they disappeared among the bushes. Then I turned to"
"the black heaps upon the ground."
"Montgomery lay on his back, with the hairy-grey Beast-man sprawling"
"across his body. The brute was dead, but still gripping Montgomery’s"
"throat with its curving claws. Near by lay M’ling on his face and quite"
"still, his neck bitten open and the upper part of the smashed"
"brandy-bottle in his hand. Two other figures lay near the fire,—the one"
"motionless, the other groaning fitfully, every now and then raising its"
"head slowly, then dropping it again."
"I caught hold of the grey man and pulled him off Montgomery’s body; his"
"claws drew down the torn coat reluctantly as I dragged him away."
"Montgomery was dark in the face and scarcely breathing. I splashed"
"sea-water on his face and pillowed his head on my rolled-up coat."
"M’ling was dead. The wounded creature by the fire—it was a Wolf-brute"
"with a bearded grey face—lay, I found, with the fore part of its body"
"upon the still glowing timber. The wretched thing was injured so"
"dreadfully that in mercy I blew its brains out at once. The other brute"
"was one of the Bull-men swathed in white. He too was dead. The rest of"
"the Beast People had vanished from the beach."
"I went to Montgomery again and knelt beside him, cursing my ignorance"
"of medicine. The fire beside me had sunk down, and only charred beams"
"of timber glowing at the central ends and mixed with a grey ash of"
"brushwood remained. I wondered casually where Montgomery had got his"
"wood. Then I saw that the dawn was upon us. The sky had grown brighter,"
"the setting moon was becoming pale and opaque in the luminous blue of"
"the day. The sky to the eastward was rimmed with red."
"Suddenly I heard a thud and a hissing behind me, and, looking round,"
"sprang to my feet with a cry of horror. Against the warm dawn great"
"tumultuous masses of black smoke were boiling up out of the enclosure,"
"and through their stormy darkness shot flickering threads of blood-red"
"flame. Then the thatched roof caught. I saw the curving charge of the"
"flames across the sloping straw. A spurt of fire jetted from the window"
"of my room."
"I knew at once what had happened. I remembered the crash I had heard."
"When I had rushed out to Montgomery’s assistance, I had overturned the"
"lamp."
"The hopelessness of saving any of the contents of the enclosure stared"
"me in the face. My mind came back to my plan of flight, and turning"
"swiftly I looked to see where the two boats lay upon the beach. They"
"were gone! Two axes lay upon the sands beside me; chips and splinters"
"were scattered broadcast, and the ashes of the bonfire were blackening"
"and smoking under the dawn. Montgomery had burnt the boats to revenge"
"himself upon me and prevent our return to mankind!"
"A sudden convulsion of rage shook me. I was almost moved to batter his"
"foolish head in, as he lay there helpless at my feet. Then suddenly his"
"hand moved, so feebly, so pitifully, that my wrath vanished. He"
"groaned, and opened his eyes for a minute. I knelt down beside him and"
"raised his head. He opened his eyes again, staring silently at the"
"dawn, and then they met mine. The lids fell."
"“Sorry,” he said presently, with an effort. He seemed trying to think."
"“The last,” he murmured, “the last of this silly universe. What a"
"mess—”"
"I listened. His head fell helplessly to one side. I thought some drink"
"might revive him; but there was neither drink nor vessel in which to"
"bring drink at hand. He seemed suddenly heavier. My heart went cold. I"
"bent down to his face, put my hand through the rent in his blouse. He"
"was dead; and even as he died a line of white heat, the limb of the"
"sun, rose eastward beyond the projection of the bay, splashing its"
"radiance across the sky and turning the dark sea into a weltering"
"tumult of dazzling light. It fell like a glory upon his death-shrunken"
"face."
"I let his head fall gently upon the rough pillow I had made for him,"
"and stood up. Before me was the glittering desolation of the sea, the"
"awful solitude upon which I had already suffered so much; behind me the"
"island, hushed under the dawn, its Beast People silent and unseen. The"
"enclosure, with all its provisions and ammunition, burnt noisily, with"
"sudden gusts of flame, a fitful crackling, and now and then a crash."
"The heavy smoke drove up the beach away from me, rolling low over the"
"distant tree-tops towards the huts in the ravine. Beside me were the"
"charred vestiges of the boats and these five dead bodies."
"Then out of the bushes came three Beast People, with hunched shoulders,"
"protruding heads, misshapen hands awkwardly held, and inquisitive,"
"unfriendly eyes and advanced towards me with hesitating gestures."
"XX."
"ALONE WITH THE BEAST FOLK."
"I faced these people, facing my fate in them, single-handed"
"now,—literally single-handed, for I had a broken arm. In my pocket was"
"a revolver with two empty chambers. Among the chips scattered about the"
"beach lay the two axes that had been used to chop up the boats. The"
"tide was creeping in behind me. There was nothing for it but courage. I"
"looked squarely into the faces of the advancing monsters. They avoided"
"my eyes, and their quivering nostrils investigated the bodies that lay"
"beyond me on the beach. I took half-a-dozen steps, picked up the"
"blood-stained whip that lay beneath the body of the Wolf-man, and"
"cracked it. They stopped and stared at me."
"“Salute!” said I. “Bow down!”"
"They hesitated. One bent his knees. I repeated my command, with my"
"heart in my mouth, and advanced upon them. One knelt, then the other"
"two."
"I turned and walked towards the dead bodies, keeping my face towards"
"the three kneeling Beast Men, very much as an actor passing up the"
"stage faces the audience."
"“They broke the Law,” said I, putting my foot on the Sayer of the Law."
"“They have been slain,—even the Sayer of the Law; even the Other with"
"the Whip. Great is the Law! Come and see.”"
"“None escape,” said one of them, advancing and peering."
"“None escape,” said I. “Therefore hear and do as I command.” They stood"
"up, looking questioningly at one another."
"“Stand there,” said I."
"I picked up the hatchets and swung them by their heads from the sling"
"of my arm; turned Montgomery over; picked up his revolver still loaded"
"in two chambers, and bending down to rummage, found half-a-dozen"
"cartridges in his pocket."
"“Take him,” said I, standing up again and pointing with the whip; “take"
"him, and carry him out and cast him into the sea.”"
"They came forward, evidently still afraid of Montgomery, but still more"
"afraid of my cracking red whip-lash; and after some fumbling and"
"hesitation, some whip-cracking and shouting, they lifted him gingerly,"
"carried him down to the beach, and went splashing into the dazzling"
"welter of the sea."
"“On!” said I, “on! Carry him far.”"
"They went in up to their armpits and stood regarding me."
"“Let go,” said I; and the body of Montgomery vanished with a splash."
"Something seemed to tighten across my chest."
"“Good!” said I, with a break in my voice; and they came back, hurrying"
"and fearful, to the margin of the water, leaving long wakes of black in"
"the silver. At the water’s edge they stopped, turning and glaring into"
"the sea as though they presently expected Montgomery to arise therefrom"
"and exact vengeance."
"“Now these,” said I, pointing to the other bodies."
"They took care not to approach the place where they had thrown"
"Montgomery into the water, but instead, carried the four dead Beast"
"People slantingly along the beach for perhaps a hundred yards before"
"they waded out and cast them away."
"As I watched them disposing of the mangled remains of M’ling, I heard a"
"light footfall behind me, and turning quickly saw the big Hyena-swine"
"perhaps a dozen yards away. His head was bent down, his bright eyes"
"were fixed upon me, his stumpy hands clenched and held close by his"
"side. He stopped in this crouching attitude when I turned, his eyes a"
"little averted."
"For a moment we stood eye to eye. I dropped the whip and snatched at"
"the pistol in my pocket; for I meant to kill this brute, the most"
"formidable of any left now upon the island, at the first excuse. It may"
"seem treacherous, but so I was resolved. I was far more afraid of him"
"than of any other two of the Beast Folk. His continued life was I knew"
"a threat against mine."
"I was perhaps a dozen seconds collecting myself. Then cried I, “Salute!"
"Bow down!”"
"His teeth flashed upon me in a snarl. “Who are _you_ that I should—”"
"Perhaps a little too spasmodically I drew my revolver, aimed quickly"
"and fired. I heard him yelp, saw him run sideways and turn, knew I had"
"missed, and clicked back the cock with my thumb for the next shot. But"
"he was already running headlong, jumping from side to side, and I dared"
"not risk another miss. Every now and then he looked back at me over his"
"shoulder. He went slanting along the beach, and vanished beneath the"
"driving masses of dense smoke that were still pouring out from the"
"burning enclosure. For some time I stood staring after him. I turned to"
"my three obedient Beast Folk again and signalled them to drop the body"
"they still carried. Then I went back to the place by the fire where the"
"bodies had fallen and kicked the sand until all the brown blood-stains"
"were absorbed and hidden."
"I dismissed my three serfs with a wave of the hand, and went up the"
"beach into the thickets. I carried my pistol in my hand, my whip thrust"
"with the hatchets in the sling of my arm. I was anxious to be alone, to"
"think out the position in which I was now placed. A dreadful thing that"
"I was only beginning to realise was, that over all this island there"
"was now no safe place where I could be alone and secure to rest or"
"sleep. I had recovered strength amazingly since my landing, but I was"
"still inclined to be nervous and to break down under any great stress."
"I felt that I ought to cross the island and establish myself with the"
"Beast People, and make myself secure in their confidence. But my heart"
"failed me. I went back to the beach, and turning eastward past the"
"burning enclosure, made for a point where a shallow spit of coral sand"
"ran out towards the reef. Here I could sit down and think, my back to"
"the sea and my face against any surprise. And there I sat, chin on"
"knees, the sun beating down upon my head and unspeakable dread in my"
"mind, plotting how I could live on against the hour of my rescue (if"
"ever rescue came). I tried to review the whole situation as calmly as I"
"could, but it was difficult to clear the thing of emotion."
"I began turning over in my mind the reason of Montgomery’s despair."
"“They will change,” he said; “they are sure to change.” And Moreau,"
"what was it that Moreau had said? “The stubborn beast-flesh grows day"
"by day back again.” Then I came round to the Hyena-swine. I felt sure"
"that if I did not kill that brute, he would kill me. The Sayer of the"
"Law was dead: worse luck. They knew now that we of the Whips could be"
"killed even as they themselves were killed. Were they peering at me"
"already out of the green masses of ferns and palms over yonder,"
"watching until I came within their spring? Were they plotting against"
"me? What was the Hyena-swine telling them? My imagination was running"
"away with me into a morass of unsubstantial fears."
"My thoughts were disturbed by a crying of sea-birds hurrying towards"
"some black object that had been stranded by the waves on the beach near"
"the enclosure. I knew what that object was, but I had not the heart to"
"go back and drive them off. I began walking along the beach in the"
"opposite direction, designing to come round the eastward corner of the"
"island and so approach the ravine of the huts, without traversing the"
"possible ambuscades of the thickets."
"Perhaps half a mile along the beach I became aware of one of my three"
"Beast Folk advancing out of the landward bushes towards me. I was now"
"so nervous with my own imaginings that I immediately drew my revolver."
"Even the propitiatory gestures of the creature failed to disarm me. He"
"hesitated as he approached."
"“Go away!” cried I."
"There was something very suggestive of a dog in the cringing attitude"
"of the creature. It retreated a little way, very like a dog being sent"
"home, and stopped, looking at me imploringly with canine brown eyes."
"“Go away,” said I. “Do not come near me.”"
"“May I not come near you?” it said."
"“No; go away,” I insisted, and snapped my whip. Then putting my whip in"
"my teeth, I stooped for a stone, and with that threat drove the"
"creature away."
"So in solitude I came round by the ravine of the Beast People, and"
"hiding among the weeds and reeds that separated this crevice from the"
"sea I watched such of them as appeared, trying to judge from their"
"gestures and appearance how the death of Moreau and Montgomery and the"
"destruction of the House of Pain had affected them. I know now the"
"folly of my cowardice. Had I kept my courage up to the level of the"
"dawn, had I not allowed it to ebb away in solitary thought, I might"
"have grasped the vacant sceptre of Moreau and ruled over the Beast"
"People. As it was I lost the opportunity, and sank to the position of a"
"mere leader among my fellows."
"Towards noon certain of them came and squatted basking in the hot sand."
"The imperious voices of hunger and thirst prevailed over my dread. I"
"came out of the bushes, and, revolver in hand, walked down towards"
"these seated figures. One, a Wolf-woman, turned her head and stared at"
"me, and then the others. None attempted to rise or salute me. I felt"
"too faint and weary to insist, and I let the moment pass."
"“I want food,” said I, almost apologetically, and drawing near."
"“There is food in the huts,” said an Ox-boar-man, drowsily, and looking"
"away from me."
"I passed them, and went down into the shadow and odours of the almost"
"deserted ravine. In an empty hut I feasted on some specked and"
"half-decayed fruit; and then after I had propped some branches and"
"sticks about the opening, and placed myself with my face towards it and"
"my hand upon my revolver, the exhaustion of the last thirty hours"
"claimed its own, and I fell into a light slumber, hoping that the"
"flimsy barricade I had erected would cause sufficient noise in its"
"removal to save me from surprise."
"XXI."
"THE REVERSION OF THE BEAST FOLK."
"In this way I became one among the Beast People in the Island of Doctor"
"Moreau. When I awoke, it was dark about me. My arm ached in its"
"bandages. I sat up, wondering at first where I might be. I heard coarse"
"voices talking outside. Then I saw that my barricade had gone, and that"
"the opening of the hut stood clear. My revolver was still in my hand."
"I heard something breathing, saw something crouched together close"
"beside me. I held my breath, trying to see what it was. It began to"
"move slowly, interminably. Then something soft and warm and moist"
"passed across my hand. All my muscles contracted. I snatched my hand"
"away. A cry of alarm began and was stifled in my throat. Then I just"
"realised what had happened sufficiently to stay my fingers on the"
"revolver."
"“Who is that?” I said in a hoarse whisper, the revolver still pointed."
"“_I_—Master.”"
"“Who are _you?_”"
"“They say there is no Master now. But I know, I know. I carried the"
"bodies into the sea, O Walker in the Sea! the bodies of those you slew."
"I am your slave, Master.”"
"“Are you the one I met on the beach?” I asked."
"“The same, Master.”"
"The Thing was evidently faithful enough, for it might have fallen upon"
"me as I slept. “It is well,” I said, extending my hand for another"
"licking kiss. I began to realise what its presence meant, and the tide"
"of my courage flowed. “Where are the others?” I asked."
"“They are mad; they are fools,” said the Dog-man. “Even now they talk"
"together beyond there. They say, ‘The Master is dead. The Other with"
"the Whip is dead. That Other who walked in the Sea is as we are. We"
"have no Master, no Whips, no House of Pain, any more. There is an end."
"We love the Law, and will keep it; but there is no Pain, no Master, no"
"Whips for ever again.’ So they say. But I know, Master, I know.”"
"I felt in the darkness, and patted the Dog-man’s head. “It is well,” I"
"said again."
"“Presently you will slay them all,” said the Dog-man."
"“Presently,” I answered, “I will slay them all,—after certain days and"
"certain things have come to pass. Every one of them save those you"
"spare, every one of them shall be slain.”"
"“What the Master wishes to kill, the Master kills,” said the Dog-man"
"with a certain satisfaction in his voice."
"“And that their sins may grow,” I said, “let them live in their folly"
"until their time is ripe. Let them not know that I am the Master.”"
"“The Master’s will is sweet,” said the Dog-man, with the ready tact of"
"his canine blood."
"“But one has sinned,” said I. “Him I will kill, whenever I may meet"
"him. When I say to you, ‘_That is he_,’ see that you fall upon him. And"
"now I will go to the men and women who are assembled together.”"
"For a moment the opening of the hut was blackened by the exit of the"
"Dog-man. Then I followed and stood up, almost in the exact spot where I"
"had been when I had heard Moreau and his staghound pursuing me. But now"
"it was night, and all the miasmatic ravine about me was black; and"
"beyond, instead of a green, sunlit slope, I saw a red fire, before"
"which hunched, grotesque figures moved to and fro. Farther were the"
"thick trees, a bank of darkness, fringed above with the black lace of"
"the upper branches. The moon was just riding up on the edge of the"
"ravine, and like a bar across its face drove the spire of vapour that"
"was for ever streaming from the fumaroles of the island."
"“Walk by me,” said I, nerving myself; and side by side we walked down"
"the narrow way, taking little heed of the dim Things that peered at us"
"out of the huts."
"None about the fire attempted to salute me. Most of them disregarded"
"me, ostentatiously. I looked round for the Hyena-swine, but he was not"
"there. Altogether, perhaps twenty of the Beast Folk squatted, staring"
"into the fire or talking to one another."
"“He is dead, he is dead! the Master is dead!” said the voice of the"
"Ape-man to the right of me. “The House of Pain—there is no House of"
"Pain!”"
"“He is not dead,” said I, in a loud voice. “Even now he watches us!”"
"This startled them. Twenty pairs of eyes regarded me."
"“The House of Pain is gone,” said I. “It will come again. The Master"
"you cannot see; yet even now he listens among you.”"
"“True, true!” said the Dog-man."
"They were staggered at my assurance. An animal may be ferocious and"
"cunning enough, but it takes a real man to tell a lie."
"“The Man with the Bandaged Arm speaks a strange thing,” said one of the"
"Beast Folk."
"“I tell you it is so,” I said. “The Master and the House of Pain will"
"come again. Woe be to him who breaks the Law!”"
"They looked curiously at one another. With an affectation of"
"indifference I began to chop idly at the ground in front of me with my"
"hatchet. They looked, I noticed, at the deep cuts I made in the turf."
"Then the Satyr raised a doubt. I answered him. Then one of the dappled"
"things objected, and an animated discussion sprang up round the fire."
"Every moment I began to feel more convinced of my present security. I"
"talked now without the catching in my breath, due to the intensity of"
"my excitement, that had troubled me at first. In the course of about an"
"hour I had really convinced several of the Beast Folk of the truth of"
"my assertions, and talked most of the others into a dubious state. I"
"kept a sharp eye for my enemy the Hyena-swine, but he never appeared."
"Every now and then a suspicious movement would startle me, but my"
"confidence grew rapidly. Then as the moon crept down from the zenith,"
"one by one the listeners began to yawn (showing the oddest teeth in the"
"light of the sinking fire), and first one and then another retired"
"towards the dens in the ravine; and I, dreading the silence and"
"darkness, went with them, knowing I was safer with several of them than"
"with one alone."
"In this manner began the longer part of my sojourn upon this Island of"
"Doctor Moreau. But from that night until the end came, there was but"
"one thing happened to tell save a series of innumerable small"
"unpleasant details and the fretting of an incessant uneasiness. So that"
"I prefer to make no chronicle for that gap of time, to tell only one"
"cardinal incident of the ten months I spent as an intimate of these"
"half-humanised brutes. There is much that sticks in my memory that I"
"could write,—things that I would cheerfully give my right hand to"
"forget; but they do not help the telling of the story."
"In the retrospect it is strange to remember how soon I fell in with"
"these monsters’ ways, and gained my confidence again. I had my quarrels"
"with them of course, and could show some of their teeth-marks still;"
"but they soon gained a wholesome respect for my trick of throwing"
"stones and for the bite of my hatchet. And my Saint-Bernard-man’s"
"loyalty was of infinite service to me. I found their simple scale of"
"honour was based mainly on the capacity for inflicting trenchant"
"wounds. Indeed, I may say—without vanity, I hope—that I held something"
"like pre-eminence among them. One or two, whom in a rare access of high"
"spirits I had scarred rather badly, bore me a grudge; but it vented"
"itself chiefly behind my back, and at a safe distance from my missiles,"
"in grimaces."
"The Hyena-swine avoided me, and I was always on the alert for him. My"
"inseparable Dog-man hated and dreaded him intensely. I really believe"
"that was at the root of the brute’s attachment to me. It was soon"
"evident to me that the former monster had tasted blood, and gone the"
"way of the Leopard-man. He formed a lair somewhere in the forest, and"
"became solitary. Once I tried to induce the Beast Folk to hunt him, but"
"I lacked the authority to make them co-operate for one end. Again and"
"again I tried to approach his den and come upon him unaware; but always"
"he was too acute for me, and saw or winded me and got away. He too made"
"every forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally with his lurking"
"ambuscades. The Dog-man scarcely dared to leave my side."
"In the first month or so the Beast Folk, compared with their latter"
"condition, were human enough, and for one or two besides my canine"
"friend I even conceived a friendly tolerance. The little pink"
"sloth-creature displayed an odd affection for me, and took to following"
"me about. The Monkey-man bored me, however; he assumed, on the strength"
"of his five digits, that he was my equal, and was for ever jabbering at"
"me,—jabbering the most arrant nonsense. One thing about him entertained"
"me a little: he had a fantastic trick of coining new words. He had an"
"idea, I believe, that to gabble about names that meant nothing was the"
"proper use of speech. He called it “Big Thinks” to distinguish it from"
"“Little Thinks,” the sane every-day interests of life. If ever I made a"
"remark he did not understand, he would praise it very much, ask me to"
"say it again, learn it by heart, and go off repeating it, with a word"
"wrong here or there, to all the milder of the Beast People. He thought"
"nothing of what was plain and comprehensible. I invented some very"
"curious “Big Thinks” for his especial use. I think now that he was the"
"silliest creature I ever met; he had developed in the most wonderful"
"way the distinctive silliness of man without losing one jot of the"
"natural folly of a monkey."
"This, I say, was in the earlier weeks of my solitude among these"
"brutes. During that time they respected the usage established by the"
"Law, and behaved with general decorum. Once I found another rabbit torn"
"to pieces,—by the Hyena-swine, I am assured,—but that was all. It was"
"about May when I first distinctly perceived a growing difference in"
"their speech and carriage, a growing coarseness of articulation, a"
"growing disinclination to talk. My Monkey-man’s jabber multiplied in"
"volume but grew less and less comprehensible, more and more simian."
"Some of the others seemed altogether slipping their hold upon speech,"
"though they still understood what I said to them at that time. (Can you"
"imagine language, once clear-cut and exact, softening and guttering,"
"losing shape and import, becoming mere lumps of sound again?) And they"
"walked erect with an increasing difficulty. Though they evidently felt"
"ashamed of themselves, every now and then I would come upon one or"
"another running on toes and finger-tips, and quite unable to recover"
"the vertical attitude. They held things more clumsily; drinking by"
"suction, feeding by gnawing, grew commoner every day. I realised more"
"keenly than ever what Moreau had told me about the “stubborn"
"beast-flesh.” They were reverting, and reverting very rapidly."
"Some of them—the pioneers in this, I noticed with some surprise, were"
"all females—began to disregard the injunction of decency, deliberately"
"for the most part. Others even attempted public outrages upon the"
"institution of monogamy. The tradition of the Law was clearly losing"
"its force. I cannot pursue this disagreeable subject."
"My Dog-man imperceptibly slipped back to the dog again; day by day he"
"became dumb, quadrupedal, hairy. I scarcely noticed the transition from"
"the companion on my right hand to the lurching dog at my side."
"As the carelessness and disorganisation increased from day to day, the"
"lane of dwelling places, at no time very sweet, became so loathsome"
"that I left it, and going across the island made myself a hovel of"
"boughs amid the black ruins of Moreau’s enclosure. Some memory of pain,"
"I found, still made that place the safest from the Beast Folk."
"It would be impossible to detail every step of the lapsing of these"
"monsters,—to tell how, day by day, the human semblance left them; how"
"they gave up bandagings and wrappings, abandoned at last every stitch"
"of clothing; how the hair began to spread over the exposed limbs; how"
"their foreheads fell away and their faces projected; how the"
"quasi-human intimacy I had permitted myself with some of them in the"
"first month of my loneliness became a shuddering horror to recall."
"The change was slow and inevitable. For them and for me it came without"
"any definite shock. I still went among them in safety, because no jolt"
"in the downward glide had released the increasing charge of explosive"
"animalism that ousted the human day by day. But I began to fear that"
"soon now that shock must come. My Saint-Bernard-brute followed me to"
"the enclosure every night, and his vigilance enabled me to sleep at"
"times in something like peace. The little pink sloth-thing became shy"
"and left me, to crawl back to its natural life once more among the"
"tree-branches. We were in just the state of equilibrium that would"
"remain in one of those “Happy Family” cages which animal-tamers"
"exhibit, if the tamer were to leave it for ever."
"Of course these creatures did not decline into such beasts as the"
"reader has seen in zoological gardens,—into ordinary bears, wolves,"
"tigers, oxen, swine, and apes. There was still something strange about"
"each; in each Moreau had blended this animal with that. One perhaps was"
"ursine chiefly, another feline chiefly, another bovine chiefly; but"
"each was tainted with other creatures,—a kind of generalised animalism"
"appearing through the specific dispositions. And the dwindling shreds"
"of the humanity still startled me every now and then,—a momentary"
"recrudescence of speech perhaps, an unexpected dexterity of the"
"fore-feet, a pitiful attempt to walk erect."
"I too must have undergone strange changes. My clothes hung about me as"
"yellow rags, through whose rents showed the tanned skin. My hair grew"
"long, and became matted together. I am told that even now my eyes have"
"a strange brightness, a swift alertness of movement."
"At first I spent the daylight hours on the southward beach watching for"
"a ship, hoping and praying for a ship. I counted on the _Ipecacuanha_"
"returning as the year wore on; but she never came. Five times I saw"
"sails, and thrice smoke; but nothing ever touched the island. I always"
"had a bonfire ready, but no doubt the volcanic reputation of the island"
"was taken to account for that."
"It was only about September or October that I began to think of making"
"a raft. By that time my arm had healed, and both my hands were at my"
"service again. At first, I found my helplessness appalling. I had never"
"done any carpentry or such-like work in my life, and I spent day after"
"day in experimental chopping and binding among the trees. I had no"
"ropes, and could hit on nothing wherewith to make ropes; none of the"
"abundant creepers seemed limber or strong enough, and with all my"
"litter of scientific education I could not devise any way of making"
"them so. I spent more than a fortnight grubbing among the black ruins"
"of the enclosure and on the beach where the boats had been burnt,"
"looking for nails and other stray pieces of metal that might prove of"
"service. Now and then some Beast-creature would watch me, and go"
"leaping off when I called to it. There came a season of thunder-storms"
"and heavy rain, which greatly retarded my work; but at last the raft"
"was completed."
"I was delighted with it. But with a certain lack of practical sense"
"which has always been my bane, I had made it a mile or more from the"
"sea; and before I had dragged it down to the beach the thing had fallen"
"to pieces. Perhaps it is as well that I was saved from launching it;"
"but at the time my misery at my failure was so acute that for some days"
"I simply moped on the beach, and stared at the water and thought of"
"death."
"I did not, however, mean to die, and an incident occurred that warned"
"me unmistakably of the folly of letting the days pass so,—for each"
"fresh day was fraught with increasing danger from the Beast People."
"I was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall, staring out to sea,"
"when I was startled by something cold touching the skin of my heel, and"
"starting round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking into my"
"face. He had long since lost speech and active movement, and the lank"
"hair of the little brute grew thicker every day and his stumpy claws"
"more askew. He made a moaning noise when he saw he had attracted my"
"attention, went a little way towards the bushes and looked back at me."
"At first I did not understand, but presently it occurred to me that he"
"wished me to follow him; and this I did at last,—slowly, for the day"
"was hot. When we reached the trees he clambered into them, for he could"
"travel better among their swinging creepers than on the ground. And"
"suddenly in a trampled space I came upon a ghastly group. My"
"Saint-Bernard-creature lay on the ground, dead; and near his body"
"crouched the Hyena-swine, gripping the quivering flesh with its"
"misshapen claws, gnawing at it, and snarling with delight. As I"
"approached, the monster lifted its glaring eyes to mine, its lips went"
"trembling back from its red-stained teeth, and it growled menacingly."
"It was not afraid and not ashamed; the last vestige of the human taint"
"had vanished. I advanced a step farther, stopped, and pulled out my"
"revolver. At last I had him face to face."
"The brute made no sign of retreat; but its ears went back, its hair"
"bristled, and its body crouched together. I aimed between the eyes and"
"fired. As I did so, the Thing rose straight at me in a leap, and I was"
"knocked over like a ninepin. It clutched at me with its crippled hand,"
"and struck me in the face. Its spring carried it over me. I fell under"
"the hind part of its body; but luckily I had hit as I meant, and it had"
"died even as it leapt. I crawled out from under its unclean weight and"
"stood up trembling, staring at its quivering body. That danger at least"
"was over; but this, I knew was only the first of the series of relapses"
"that must come."
"I burnt both of the bodies on a pyre of brushwood; but after that I saw"
"that unless I left the island my death was only a question of time. The"
"Beast People by that time had, with one or two exceptions, left the"
"ravine and made themselves lairs according to their taste among the"
"thickets of the island. Few prowled by day, most of them slept, and the"
"island might have seemed deserted to a new-comer; but at night the air"
"was hideous with their calls and howling. I had half a mind to make a"
"massacre of them; to build traps, or fight them with my knife. Had I"
"possessed sufficient cartridges, I should not have hesitated to begin"
"the killing. There could now be scarcely a score left of the dangerous"
"carnivores; the braver of these were already dead. After the death of"
"this poor dog of mine, my last friend, I too adopted to some extent the"
"practice of slumbering in the daytime in order to be on my guard at"
"night. I rebuilt my den in the walls of the enclosure, with such a"
"narrow opening that anything attempting to enter must necessarily make"
"a considerable noise. The creatures had lost the art of fire too, and"
"recovered their fear of it. I turned once more, almost passionately"
"now, to hammering together stakes and branches to form a raft for my"
"escape."
"I found a thousand difficulties. I am an extremely unhandy man (my"
"schooling was over before the days of Slöjd); but most of the"
"requirements of a raft I met at last in some clumsy, circuitous way or"
"other, and this time I took care of the strength. The only"
"insurmountable obstacle was that I had no vessel to contain the water I"
"should need if I floated forth upon these untravelled seas. I would"
"have even tried pottery, but the island contained no clay. I used to go"
"moping about the island trying with all my might to solve this one last"
"difficulty. Sometimes I would give way to wild outbursts of rage, and"
"hack and splinter some unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation. But I"
"could think of nothing."
"And then came a day, a wonderful day, which I spent in ecstasy. I saw a"
"sail to the southwest, a small sail like that of a little schooner; and"
"forthwith I lit a great pile of brushwood, and stood by it in the heat"
"of it, and the heat of the midday sun, watching. All day I watched that"
"sail, eating or drinking nothing, so that my head reeled; and the"
"Beasts came and glared at me, and seemed to wonder, and went away. It"
"was still distant when night came and swallowed it up; and all night I"
"toiled to keep my blaze bright and high, and the eyes of the Beasts"
"shone out of the darkness, marvelling. In the dawn the sail was nearer,"
"and I saw it was the dirty lug-sail of a small boat. But it sailed"
"strangely. My eyes were weary with watching, and I peered and could not"
"believe them. Two men were in the boat, sitting low down,—one by the"
"bows, the other at the rudder. The head was not kept to the wind; it"
"yawed and fell away."
"As the day grew brighter, I began waving the last rag of my jacket to"
"them; but they did not notice me, and sat still, facing each other. I"
"went to the lowest point of the low headland, and gesticulated and"
"shouted. There was no response, and the boat kept on her aimless"
"course, making slowly, very slowly, for the bay. Suddenly a great white"
"bird flew up out of the boat, and neither of the men stirred nor"
"noticed it; it circled round, and then came sweeping overhead with its"
"strong wings outspread."
"Then I stopped shouting, and sat down on the headland and rested my"
"chin on my hands and stared. Slowly, slowly, the boat drove past"
"towards the west. I would have swum out to it, but something—a cold,"
"vague fear—kept me back. In the afternoon the tide stranded the boat,"
"and left it a hundred yards or so to the westward of the ruins of the"
"enclosure. The men in it were dead, had been dead so long that they"
"fell to pieces when I tilted the boat on its side and dragged them out."
"One had a shock of red hair, like the captain of the _Ipecacuanha_, and"
"a dirty white cap lay in the bottom of the boat."
"As I stood beside the boat, three of the Beasts came slinking out of"
"the bushes and sniffing towards me. One of my spasms of disgust came"
"upon me. I thrust the little boat down the beach and clambered on board"
"her. Two of the brutes were Wolf-beasts, and came forward with"
"quivering nostrils and glittering eyes; the third was the horrible"
"nondescript of bear and bull. When I saw them approaching those"
"wretched remains, heard them snarling at one another and caught the"
"gleam of their teeth, a frantic horror succeeded my repulsion. I turned"
"my back upon them, struck the lug and began paddling out to sea. I"
"could not bring myself to look behind me."
"I lay, however, between the reef and the island that night, and the"
"next morning went round to the stream and filled the empty keg aboard"
"with water. Then, with such patience as I could command, I collected a"
"quantity of fruit, and waylaid and killed two rabbits with my last"
"three cartridges. While I was doing this I left the boat moored to an"
"inward projection of the reef, for fear of the Beast People."
"XXII."
"THE MAN ALONE."
"In the evening I started, and drove out to sea before a gentle wind"
"from the southwest, slowly, steadily; and the island grew smaller and"
"smaller, and the lank spire of smoke dwindled to a finer and finer line"
"against the hot sunset. The ocean rose up around me, hiding that low,"
"dark patch from my eyes. The daylight, the trailing glory of the sun,"
"went streaming out of the sky, was drawn aside like some luminous"
"curtain, and at last I looked into the blue gulf of immensity which the"
"sunshine hides, and saw the floating hosts of the stars. The sea was"
"silent, the sky was silent. I was alone with the night and silence."
"So I drifted for three days, eating and drinking sparingly, and"
"meditating upon all that had happened to me,—not desiring very greatly"
"then to see men again. One unclean rag was about me, my hair a black"
"tangle: no doubt my discoverers thought me a madman."
"It is strange, but I felt no desire to return to mankind. I was only"
"glad to be quit of the foulness of the Beast People. And on the third"
"day I was picked up by a brig from Apia to San Francisco. Neither the"
"captain nor the mate would believe my story, judging that solitude and"
"danger had made me mad; and fearing their opinion might be that of"
"others, I refrained from telling my adventure further, and professed to"
"recall nothing that had happened to me between the loss of the _Lady"
"Vain_ and the time when I was picked up again,—the space of a year."
"I had to act with the utmost circumspection to save myself from the"
"suspicion of insanity. My memory of the Law, of the two dead sailors,"
"of the ambuscades of the darkness, of the body in the canebrake,"
"haunted me; and, unnatural as it seems, with my return to mankind came,"
"instead of that confidence and sympathy I had expected, a strange"
"enhancement of the uncertainty and dread I had experienced during my"
"stay upon the island. No one would believe me; I was almost as queer to"
"men as I had been to the Beast People. I may have caught something of"
"the natural wildness of my companions. They say that terror is a"
"disease, and anyhow I can witness that for several years now a restless"
"fear has dwelt in my mind,—such a restless fear as a half-tamed lion"
"cub may feel."
"My trouble took the strangest form. I could not persuade myself that"
"the men and women I met were not also another Beast People, animals"
"half wrought into the outward image of human souls, and that they would"
"presently begin to revert,—to show first this bestial mark and then"
"that. But I have confided my case to a strangely able man,—a man who"
"had known Moreau, and seemed half to credit my story; a mental"
"specialist,—and he has helped me mightily, though I do not expect that"
"the terror of that island will ever altogether leave me. At most times"
"it lies far in the back of my mind, a mere distant cloud, a memory, and"
"a faint distrust; but there are times when the little cloud spreads"
"until it obscures the whole sky. Then I look about me at my fellow-men;"
"and I go in fear. I see faces, keen and bright; others dull or"
"dangerous; others, unsteady, insincere,—none that have the calm"
"authority of a reasonable soul. I feel as though the animal was surging"
"up through them; that presently the degradation of the Islanders will"
"be played over again on a larger scale. I know this is an illusion;"
"that these seeming men and women about me are indeed men and women,—men"
"and women for ever, perfectly reasonable creatures, full of human"
"desires and tender solicitude, emancipated from instinct and the slaves"
"of no fantastic Law,—beings altogether different from the Beast Folk."
"Yet I shrink from them, from their curious glances, their inquiries and"
"assistance, and long to be away from them and alone. For that reason I"
"live near the broad free downland, and can escape thither when this"
"shadow is over my soul; and very sweet is the empty downland then,"
"under the wind-swept sky."
"When I lived in London the horror was well-nigh insupportable. I could"
"not get away from men: their voices came through windows; locked doors"
"were flimsy safeguards. I would go out into the streets to fight with"
"my delusion, and prowling women would mew after me; furtive, craving"
"men glance jealously at me; weary, pale workers go coughing by me with"
"tired eyes and eager paces, like wounded deer dripping blood; old"
"people, bent and dull, pass murmuring to themselves; and, all"
"unheeding, a ragged tail of gibing children. Then I would turn aside"
"into some chapel,—and even there, such was my disturbance, it seemed"
"that the preacher gibbered “Big Thinks,” even as the Ape-man had done;"
"or into some library, and there the intent faces over the books seemed"
"but patient creatures waiting for prey. Particularly nauseous were the"
"blank, expressionless faces of people in trains and omnibuses; they"
"seemed no more my fellow-creatures than dead bodies would be, so that I"
"did not dare to travel unless I was assured of being alone. And even it"
"seemed that I too was not a reasonable creature, but only an animal"
"tormented with some strange disorder in its brain which sent it to"
"wander alone, like a sheep stricken with gid."
"This is a mood, however, that comes to me now, I thank God, more"
"rarely. I have withdrawn myself from the confusion of cities and"
"multitudes, and spend my days surrounded by wise books,—bright windows"
"in this life of ours, lit by the shining souls of men. I see few"
"strangers, and have but a small household. My days I devote to reading"
"and to experiments in chemistry, and I spend many of the clear nights"
"in the study of astronomy. There is—though I do not know how there is"
"or why there is—a sense of infinite peace and protection in the"
"glittering hosts of heaven. There it must be, I think, in the vast and"
"eternal laws of matter, and not in the daily cares and sins and"
"troubles of men, that whatever is more than animal within us must find"
"its solace and its hope. I _hope_, or I could not live."
"And so, in hope and solitude, my story ends."
"EDWARD PRENDICK."

"I"
"One confidential evening, not three months ago, Lionel Wallace told me"
"this story of the Door in the Wall. And at the time I thought that so"
"far as he was concerned it was a true story."
"He told it me with such a direct simplicity of conviction that I could"
"not do otherwise than believe in him. But in the morning, in my own"
"flat, I woke to a different atmosphere, and as I lay in bed and"
"recalled the things he had told me, stripped of the glamour of his"
"earnest slow voice, denuded of the focussed shaded table light, the"
"shadowy atmosphere that wrapped about him and the pleasant bright"
"things, the dessert and glasses and napery of the dinner we had shared,"
"making them for the time a bright little world quite cut off from"
"every-day realities, I saw it all as frankly incredible. “He was"
"mystifying!” I said, and then: “How well he did it!. . . . . It isn’t"
"quite the thing I should have expected him, of all people, to do well.”"
"Afterwards, as I sat up in bed and sipped my morning tea, I found"
"myself trying to account for the flavour of reality that perplexed me"
"in his impossible reminiscences, by supposing they did in some way"
"suggest, present, convey—I hardly know which word to use—experiences it"
"was otherwise impossible to tell."
"Well, I don’t resort to that explanation now. I have got over my"
"intervening doubts. I believe now, as I believed at the moment of"
"telling, that Wallace did to the very best of his ability strip the"
"truth of his secret for me. But whether he himself saw, or only thought"
"he saw, whether he himself was the possessor of an inestimable"
"privilege, or the victim of a fantastic dream, I cannot pretend to"
"guess. Even the facts of his death, which ended my doubts forever,"
"throw no light on that. That much the reader must judge for himself."
"I forget now what chance comment or criticism of mine moved so reticent"
"a man to confide in me. He was, I think, defending himself against an"
"imputation of slackness and unreliability I had made in relation to a"
"great public movement in which he had disappointed me. But he plunged"
"suddenly. “I have” he said, “a preoccupation—”"
"“I know,” he went on, after a pause that he devoted to the study of his"
"cigar ash, “I have been negligent. The fact is—it isn’t a case of"
"ghosts or apparitions—but—it’s an odd thing to tell of, Redmond—I am"
"haunted. I am haunted by something—that rather takes the light out of"
"things, that fills me with longings . . . . .”"
"He paused, checked by that English shyness that so often overcomes us"
"when we would speak of moving or grave or beautiful things. “You were"
"at Saint Athelstan’s all through,” he said, and for a moment that"
"seemed to me quite irrelevant. “Well”—and he paused. Then very"
"haltingly at first, but afterwards more easily, he began to tell of the"
"thing that was hidden in his life, the haunting memory of a beauty and"
"a happiness that filled his heart with insatiable longings that made"
"all the interests and spectacle of worldly life seem dull and tedious"
"and vain to him."
"Now that I have the clue to it, the thing seems written visibly in his"
"face. I have a photograph in which that look of detachment has been"
"caught and intensified. It reminds me of what a woman once said of"
"him—a woman who had loved him greatly. “Suddenly,” she said, “the"
"interest goes out of him. He forgets you. He doesn’t care a rap for"
"you—under his very nose . . . . .”"
"Yet the interest was not always out of him, and when he was holding his"
"attention to a thing Wallace could contrive to be an extremely"
"successful man. His career, indeed, is set with successes. He left me"
"behind him long ago; he soared up over my head, and cut a figure in the"
"world that I couldn’t cut—anyhow. He was still a year short of forty,"
"and they say now that he would have been in office and very probably in"
"the new Cabinet if he had lived. At school he always beat me without"
"effort—as it were by nature. We were at school together at Saint"
"Athelstan’s College in West Kensington for almost all our school time."
"He came into the school as my co-equal, but he left far above me, in a"
"blaze of scholarships and brilliant performance. Yet I think I made a"
"fair average running. And it was at school I heard first of the Door in"
"the Wall—that I was to hear of a second time only a month before his"
"death."
"To him at least the Door in the Wall was a real door leading through a"
"real wall to immortal realities. Of that I am now quite assured."
"And it came into his life early, when he was a little fellow between"
"five and six. I remember how, as he sat making his confession to me"
"with a slow gravity, he reasoned and reckoned the date of it. “There"
"was,” he said, “a crimson Virginia creeper in it—all one bright uniform"
"crimson in a clear amber sunshine against a white wall. That came into"
"the impression somehow, though I don’t clearly remember how, and there"
"were horse-chestnut leaves upon the clean pavement outside the green"
"door. They were blotched yellow and green, you know, not brown nor"
"dirty, so that they must have been new fallen. I take it that means"
"October. I look out for horse-chestnut leaves every year, and I ought"
"to know."
"“If I’m right in that, I was about five years and four months old.”"
"He was, he said, rather a precocious little boy—he learned to talk at"
"an abnormally early age, and he was so sane and “old-fashioned,” as"
"people say, that he was permitted an amount of initiative that most"
"children scarcely attain by seven or eight. His mother died when he was"
"born, and he was under the less vigilant and authoritative care of a"
"nursery governess. His father was a stern, preoccupied lawyer, who gave"
"him little attention, and expected great things of him. For all his"
"brightness he found life a little grey and dull I think. And one day he"
"wandered."
"He could not recall the particular neglect that enabled him to get"
"away, nor the course he took among the West Kensington roads. All that"
"had faded among the incurable blurs of memory. But the white wall and"
"the green door stood out quite distinctly."
"As his memory of that remote childish experience ran, he did at the"
"very first sight of that door experience a peculiar emotion, an"
"attraction, a desire to get to the door and open it and walk in. And at"
"the same time he had the clearest conviction that either it was unwise"
"or it was wrong of him—he could not tell which—to yield to this"
"attraction. He insisted upon it as a curious thing that he knew from"
"the very beginning—unless memory has played him the queerest trick—that"
"the door was unfastened, and that he could go in as he chose."
"I seem to see the figure of that little boy, drawn and repelled. And it"
"was very clear in his mind, too, though why it should be so was never"
"explained, that his father would be very angry if he went through that"
"door."
"Wallace described all these moments of hesitation to me with the utmost"
"particularity. He went right past the door, and then, with his hands in"
"his pockets, and making an infantile attempt to whistle, strolled right"
"along beyond the end of the wall. There he recalls a number of mean,"
"dirty shops, and particularly that of a plumber and decorator, with a"
"dusty disorder of earthenware pipes, sheet lead ball taps, pattern"
"books of wall paper, and tins of enamel. He stood pretending to examine"
"these things, and coveting, passionately desiring the green door."
"Then, he said, he had a gust of emotion. He made a run for it, lest"
"hesitation should grip him again, he went plump with outstretched hand"
"through the green door and let it slam behind him. And so, in a trice,"
"he came into the garden that has haunted all his life."
"It was very difficult for Wallace to give me his full sense of that"
"garden into which he came."
"There was something in the very air of it that exhilarated, that gave"
"one a sense of lightness and good happening and well being; there was"
"something in the sight of it that made all its colour clean and perfect"
"and subtly luminous. In the instant of coming into it one was"
"exquisitely glad—as only in rare moments and when one is young and"
"joyful one can be glad in this world. And everything was beautiful"
"there . . . . ."
"Wallace mused before he went on telling me. “You see,” he said, with"
"the doubtful inflection of a man who pauses at incredible things,"
"“there were two great panthers there . . . Yes, spotted panthers. And I"
"was not afraid. There was a long wide path with marble-edged flower"
"borders on either side, and these two huge velvety beasts were playing"
"there with a ball. One looked up and came towards me, a little curious"
"as it seemed. It came right up to me, rubbed its soft round ear very"
"gently against the small hand I held out and purred. It was, I tell"
"you, an enchanted garden. I know. And the size? Oh! it stretched far"
"and wide, this way and that. I believe there were hills far away."
"Heaven knows where West Kensington had suddenly got to. And somehow it"
"was just like coming home."
"“You know, in the very moment the door swung to behind me, I forgot the"
"road with its fallen chestnut leaves, its cabs and tradesmen’s carts, I"
"forgot the sort of gravitational pull back to the discipline and"
"obedience of home, I forgot all hesitations and fear, forgot"
"discretion, forgot all the intimate realities of this life. I became in"
"a moment a very glad and wonder-happy little boy—in another world. It"
"was a world with a different quality, a warmer, more penetrating and"
"mellower light, with a faint clear gladness in its air, and wisps of"
"sun-touched cloud in the blueness of its sky. And before me ran this"
"long wide path, invitingly, with weedless beds on either side, rich"
"with untended flowers, and these two great panthers. I put my little"
"hands fearlessly on their soft fur, and caressed their round ears and"
"the sensitive corners under their ears, and played with them, and it"
"was as though they welcomed me home. There was a keen sense of"
"home-coming in my mind, and when presently a tall, fair girl appeared"
"in the pathway and came to meet me, smiling, and said Well?’ to me, and"
"lifted me, and kissed me, and put me down, and led me by the hand,"
"there was no amazement, but only an impression of delightful rightness,"
"of being reminded of happy things that had in some strange way been"
"overlooked. There were broad steps, I remember, that came into view"
"between spikes of delphinium, and up these we went to a great avenue"
"between very old and shady dark trees. All down this avenue, you know,"
"between the red chapped stems, were marble seats of honour and"
"statuary, and very tame and friendly white doves . . . . ."
"“And along this avenue my girl-friend led me, looking down—I recall the"
"pleasant lines, the finely-modelled chin of her sweet kind face—asking"
"me questions in a soft, agreeable voice, and telling me things,"
"pleasant things I know, though what they were I was never able to"
"recall . . . And presently a little Capuchin monkey, very clean, with a"
"fur of ruddy brown and kindly hazel eyes, came down a tree to us and"
"ran beside me, looking up at me and grinning, and presently leapt to my"
"shoulder. So we went on our way in great happiness . . . .”"
"He paused."
"“Go on,” I said."
"“I remember little things. We passed an old man musing among laurels, I"
"remember, and a place gay with paroquets, and came through a broad"
"shaded colonnade to a spacious cool palace, full of pleasant fountains,"
"full of beautiful things, full of the quality and promise of heart’s"
"desire. And there were many things and many people, some that still"
"seem to stand out clearly and some that are a little vague, but all"
"these people were beautiful and kind. In some way—I don’t know how—it"
"was conveyed to me that they all were kind to me, glad to have me"
"there, and filling me with gladness by their gestures, by the touch of"
"their hands, by the welcome and love in their eyes. Yes—”"
"He mused for awhile. “Playmates I found there. That was very much to"
"me, because I was a lonely little boy. They played delightful games in"
"a grass-covered court where there was a sun-dial set about with"
"flowers. And as one played one loved . . . ."
"“But—it’s odd—there’s a gap in my memory. I don’t remember the games we"
"played. I never remembered. Afterwards, as a child, I spent long hours"
"trying, even with tears, to recall the form of that happiness. I wanted"
"to play it all over again—in my nursery—by myself. No! All I remember"
"is the happiness and two dear playfellows who were most with me . . . ."
"Then presently came a sombre dark woman, with a grave, pale face and"
"dreamy eyes, a sombre woman wearing a soft long robe of pale purple,"
"who carried a book and beckoned and took me aside with her into a"
"gallery above a hall—though my playmates were loth to have me go, and"
"ceased their game and stood watching as I was carried away. ‘Come back"
"to us!’ they cried. ‘Come back to us soon!’ I looked up at her face,"
"but she heeded them not at all. Her face was very gentle and grave. She"
"took me to a seat in the gallery, and I stood beside her, ready to look"
"at her book as she opened it upon her knee. The pages fell open. She"
"pointed, and I looked, marvelling, for in the living pages of that book"
"I saw myself; it was a story about myself, and in it were all the"
"things that had happened to me since ever I was born . . . ."
"“It was wonderful to me, because the pages of that book were not"
"pictures, you understand, but realities.”"
"Wallace paused gravely—looked at me doubtfully."
"“Go on,” I said. “I understand.”"
"“They were realities—yes, they must have been; people moved and things"
"came and went in them; my dear mother, whom I had near forgotten; then"
"my father, stern and upright, the servants, the nursery, all the"
"familiar things of home. Then the front door and the busy streets, with"
"traffic to and fro: I looked and marvelled, and looked half doubtfully"
"again into the woman’s face and turned the pages over, skipping this"
"and that, to see more of this book, and more, and so at last I came to"
"myself hovering and hesitating outside the green door in the long white"
"wall, and felt again the conflict and the fear."
"“‘And next?’ I cried, and would have turned on, but the cool hand of"
"the grave woman delayed me."
"“‘Next?’ I insisted, and struggled gently with her hand, pulling up her"
"fingers with all my childish strength, and as she yielded and the page"
"came over she bent down upon me like a shadow and kissed my brow."
"“But the page did not show the enchanted garden, nor the panthers, nor"
"the girl who had led me by the hand, nor the playfellows who had been"
"so loth to let me go. It showed a long grey street in West Kensington,"
"on that chill hour of afternoon before the lamps are lit, and I was"
"there, a wretched little figure, weeping aloud, for all that I could do"
"to restrain myself, and I was weeping because I could not return to my"
"dear play-fellows who had called after me, ‘Come back to us! Come back"
"to us soon!’ I was there. This was no page in a book, but harsh"
"reality; that enchanted place and the restraining hand of the grave"
"mother at whose knee I stood had gone—whither have they gone?”"
"He halted again, and remained for a time, staring into the fire."
"“Oh! the wretchedness of that return!” he murmured."
"“Well?” I said after a minute or so."
"“Poor little wretch I was—brought back to this grey world again! As I"
"realised the fulness of what had happened to me, I gave way to quite"
"ungovernable grief. And the shame and humiliation of that public"
"weeping and my disgraceful homecoming remain with me still. I see again"
"the benevolent-looking old gentleman in gold spectacles who stopped and"
"spoke to me—prodding me first with his umbrella. ‘Poor little chap,’"
"said he; ‘and are you lost then?’—and me a London boy of five and more!"
"And he must needs bring in a kindly young policeman and make a crowd of"
"me, and so march me home. Sobbing, conspicuous and frightened, I came"
"from the enchanted garden to the steps of my father’s house."
"“That is as well as I can remember my vision of that garden—the garden"
"that haunts me still. Of course, I can convey nothing of that"
"indescribable quality of translucent unreality, that difference from"
"the common things of experience that hung about it all; but that—that"
"is what happened. If it was a dream, I am sure it was a day-time and"
"altogether extraordinary dream . . . . . . H’m!—naturally there"
"followed a terrible questioning, by my aunt, my father, the nurse, the"
"governess—everyone . . . . . ."
"“I tried to tell them, and my father gave me my first thrashing for"
"telling lies. When afterwards I tried to tell my aunt, she punished me"
"again for my wicked persistence. Then, as I said, everyone was"
"forbidden to listen to me, to hear a word about it. Even my fairy tale"
"books were taken away from me for a time—because I was ‘too"
"imaginative.’ Eh? Yes, they did that! My father belonged to the old"
"school . . . . . And my story was driven back upon myself. I whispered"
"it to my pillow—my pillow that was often damp and salt to my whispering"
"lips with childish tears. And I added always to my official and less"
"fervent prayers this one heartfelt request: ‘Please God I may dream of"
"the garden. Oh! take me back to my garden! Take me back to my garden!’"
"“I dreamt often of the garden. I may have added to it, I may have"
"changed it; I do not know . . . . . All this you understand is an"
"attempt to reconstruct from fragmentary memories a very early"
"experience. Between that and the other consecutive memories of my"
"boyhood there is a gulf. A time came when it seemed impossible I should"
"ever speak of that wonder glimpse again.”"
"I asked an obvious question."
"“No,” he said. “I don’t remember that I ever attempted to find my way"
"back to the garden in those early years. This seems odd to me now, but"
"I think that very probably a closer watch was kept on my movements"
"after this misadventure to prevent my going astray. No, it wasn’t until"
"you knew me that I tried for the garden again. And I believe there was"
"a period—incredible as it seems now—when I forgot the garden"
"altogether—when I was about eight or nine it may have been. Do you"
"remember me as a kid at Saint Athelstan’s?”"
"“Rather!”"
"“I didn’t show any signs did I in those days of having a secret dream?”"
"II"
"He looked up with a sudden smile."
"“Did you ever play North-West Passage with me? . . . . . No, of course"
"you didn’t come my way!”"
"“It was the sort of game,” he went on, “that every imaginative child"
"plays all day. The idea was the discovery of a North-West Passage to"
"school. The way to school was plain enough; the game consisted in"
"finding some way that wasn’t plain, starting off ten minutes early in"
"some almost hopeless direction, and working one’s way round through"
"unaccustomed streets to my goal. And one day I got entangled among some"
"rather low-class streets on the other side of Campden Hill, and I began"
"to think that for once the game would be against me and that I should"
"get to school late. I tried rather desperately a street that seemed a"
"_cul de sac_, and found a passage at the end. I hurried through that"
"with renewed hope. ‘I shall do it yet,’ I said, and passed a row of"
"frowsy little shops that were inexplicably familiar to me, and behold!"
"there was my long white wall and the green door that led to the"
"enchanted garden!"
"“The thing whacked upon me suddenly. Then, after all, that garden, that"
"wonderful garden, wasn’t a dream!” . . . ."
"He paused."
"“I suppose my second experience with the green door marks the world of"
"difference there is between the busy life of a schoolboy and the"
"infinite leisure of a child. Anyhow, this second time I didn’t for a"
"moment think of going in straight away. You see . . . For one thing my"
"mind was full of the idea of getting to school in time—set on not"
"breaking my record for punctuality. I must surely have felt _some_"
"little desire at least to try the door—yes, I must have felt that . . ."
". . But I seem to remember the attraction of the door mainly as another"
"obstacle to my overmastering determination to get to school. I was"
"immediately interested by this discovery I had made, of course—I went"
"on with my mind full of it—but I went on. It didn’t check me. I ran"
"past tugging out my watch, found I had ten minutes still to spare, and"
"then I was going downhill into familiar surroundings. I got to school,"
"breathless, it is true, and wet with perspiration, but in time. I can"
"remember hanging up my coat and hat . . . Went right by it and left it"
"behind me. Odd, eh?”"
"He looked at me thoughtfully. “Of course, I didn’t know then that it"
"wouldn’t always be there. School boys have limited imaginations. I"
"suppose I thought it was an awfully jolly thing to have it there, to"
"know my way back to it, but there was the school tugging at me. I"
"expect I was a good deal distraught and inattentive that morning,"
"recalling what I could of the beautiful strange people I should"
"presently see again. Oddly enough I had no doubt in my mind that they"
"would be glad to see me . . . Yes, I must have thought of the garden"
"that morning just as a jolly sort of place to which one might resort in"
"the interludes of a strenuous scholastic career."
"“I didn’t go that day at all. The next day was a half holiday, and that"
"may have weighed with me. Perhaps, too, my state of inattention brought"
"down impositions upon me and docked the margin of time necessary for"
"the detour. I don’t know. What I do know is that in the meantime the"
"enchanted garden was so much upon my mind that I could not keep it to"
"myself."
"“I told—What was his name?—a ferrety-looking youngster we used to call"
"Squiff.”"
"“Young Hopkins,” said I."
"“Hopkins it was. I did not like telling him, I had a feeling that in"
"some way it was against the rules to tell him, but I did. He was"
"walking part of the way home with me; he was talkative, and if we had"
"not talked about the enchanted garden we should have talked of"
"something else, and it was intolerable to me to think about any other"
"subject. So I blabbed."
"“Well, he told my secret. The next day in the play interval I found"
"myself surrounded by half a dozen bigger boys, half teasing and wholly"
"curious to hear more of the enchanted garden. There was that big"
"Fawcett—you remember him?—and Carnaby and Morley Reynolds. You weren’t"
"there by any chance? No, I think I should have remembered if you were ."
". . . ."
"“A boy is a creature of odd feelings. I was, I really believe, in spite"
"of my secret self-disgust, a little flattered to have the attention of"
"these big fellows. I remember particularly a moment of pleasure caused"
"by the praise of Crawshaw—you remember Crawshaw major, the son of"
"Crawshaw the composer?—who said it was the best lie he had ever heard."
"But at the same time there was a really painful undertow of shame at"
"telling what I felt was indeed a sacred secret. That beast Fawcett made"
"a joke about the girl in green—.”"
"Wallace’s voice sank with the keen memory of that shame. “I pretended"
"not to hear,” he said. “Well, then Carnaby suddenly called me a young"
"liar and disputed with me when I said the thing was true. I said I knew"
"where to find the green door, could lead them all there in ten minutes."
"Carnaby became outrageously virtuous, and said I’d have to—and bear out"
"my words or suffer. Did you ever have Carnaby twist your arm? Then"
"perhaps you’ll understand how it went with me. I swore my story was"
"true. There was nobody in the school then to save a chap from Carnaby"
"though Crawshaw put in a word or so. Carnaby had got his game. I grew"
"excited and red-eared, and a little frightened, I behaved altogether"
"like a silly little chap, and the outcome of it all was that instead of"
"starting alone for my enchanted garden, I led the way presently—cheeks"
"flushed, ears hot, eyes smarting, and my soul one burning misery and"
"shame—for a party of six mocking, curious and threatening"
"school-fellows."
"“We never found the white wall and the green door . . .”"
"“You mean?—”"
"“I mean I couldn’t find it. I would have found it if I could."
"“And afterwards when I could go alone I couldn’t find it. I never found"
"it. I seem now to have been always looking for it through my school-boy"
"days, but I’ve never come upon it again.”"
"“Did the fellows—make it disagreeable?”"
"“Beastly . . . . . Carnaby held a council over me for wanton lying. I"
"remember how I sneaked home and upstairs to hide the marks of my"
"blubbering. But when I cried myself to sleep at last it wasn’t for"
"Carnaby, but for the garden, for the beautiful afternoon I had hoped"
"for, for the sweet friendly women and the waiting playfellows and the"
"game I had hoped to learn again, that beautiful forgotten game . . . ."
"."
"“I believed firmly that if I had not told— . . . . . I had bad times"
"after that—crying at night and wool-gathering by day. For two terms I"
"slackened and had bad reports. Do you remember? Of course you would! It"
"was _you_—your beating me in mathematics that brought me back to the"
"grind again.”"
"III"
"For a time my friend stared silently into the red heart of the fire."
"Then he said: “I never saw it again until I was seventeen."
"“It leapt upon me for the third time—as I was driving to Paddington on"
"my way to Oxford and a scholarship. I had just one momentary glimpse. I"
"was leaning over the apron of my hansom smoking a cigarette, and no"
"doubt thinking myself no end of a man of the world, and suddenly there"
"was the door, the wall, the dear sense of unforgettable and still"
"attainable things."
"“We clattered by—I too taken by surprise to stop my cab until we were"
"well past and round a corner. Then I had a queer moment, a double and"
"divergent movement of my will: I tapped the little door in the roof of"
"the cab, and brought my arm down to pull out my watch. ‘Yes, sir!’ said"
"the cabman, smartly. ‘Er—well—it’s nothing,’ I cried. ‘_My_ mistake! We"
"haven’t much time! Go on!’ and he went on . . ."
"“I got my scholarship. And the night after I was told of that I sat"
"over my fire in my little upper room, my study, in my father’s house,"
"with his praise—his rare praise—and his sound counsels ringing in my"
"ears, and I smoked my favourite pipe—the formidable bulldog of"
"adolescence—and thought of that door in the long white wall. ‘If I had"
"stopped,’ I thought, ‘I should have missed my scholarship, I should"
"have missed Oxford—muddled all the fine career before me! I begin to"
"see things better!’ I fell musing deeply, but I did not doubt then this"
"career of mine was a thing that merited sacrifice."
"“Those dear friends and that clear atmosphere seemed very sweet to me,"
"very fine, but remote. My grip was fixing now upon the world. I saw"
"another door opening—the door of my career.”"
"He stared again into the fire. Its red lights picked out a stubborn"
"strength in his face for just one flickering moment, and then it"
"vanished again."
"“Well”, he said and sighed, “I have served that career. I have"
"done—much work, much hard work. But I have dreamt of the enchanted"
"garden a thousand dreams, and seen its door, or at least glimpsed its"
"door, four times since then. Yes—four times. For a while this world was"
"so bright and interesting, seemed so full of meaning and opportunity"
"that the half-effaced charm of the garden was by comparison gentle and"
"remote. Who wants to pat panthers on the way to dinner with pretty"
"women and distinguished men? I came down to London from Oxford, a man"
"of bold promise that I have done something to redeem. Something—and yet"
"there have been disappointments . . . . ."
"“Twice I have been in love—I will not dwell on that—but once, as I went"
"to someone who, I know, doubted whether I dared to come, I took a short"
"cut at a venture through an unfrequented road near Earl’s Court, and so"
"happened on a white wall and a familiar green door. ‘Odd!’ said I to"
"myself, ‘but I thought this place was on Campden Hill. It’s the place I"
"never could find somehow—like counting Stonehenge—the place of that"
"queer day dream of mine.’ And I went by it intent upon my purpose. It"
"had no appeal to me that afternoon."
"“I had just a moment’s impulse to try the door, three steps aside were"
"needed at the most—though I was sure enough in my heart that it would"
"open to me—and then I thought that doing so might delay me on the way"
"to that appointment in which I thought my honour was involved."
"Afterwards I was sorry for my punctuality—I might at least have peeped"
"in I thought, and waved a hand to those panthers, but I knew enough by"
"this time not to seek again belatedly that which is not found by"
"seeking. Yes, that time made me very sorry . . . . ."
"“Years of hard work after that and never a sight of the door. It’s only"
"recently it has come back to me. With it there has come a sense as"
"though some thin tarnish had spread itself over my world. I began to"
"think of it as a sorrowful and bitter thing that I should never see"
"that door again. Perhaps I was suffering a little from overwork—perhaps"
"it was what I’ve heard spoken of as the feeling of forty. I don’t know."
"But certainly the keen brightness that makes effort easy has gone out"
"of things recently, and that just at a time with all these new"
"political developments—when I ought to be working. Odd, isn’t it? But I"
"do begin to find life toilsome, its rewards, as I come near them,"
"cheap. I began a little while ago to want the garden quite badly."
"Yes—and I’ve seen it three times.”"
"“The garden?”"
"“No—the door! And I haven’t gone in!”"
"He leaned over the table to me, with an enormous sorrow in his voice as"
"he spoke. “Thrice I have had my chance—_thrice!_ If ever that door"
"offers itself to me again, I swore, I will go in out of this dust and"
"heat, out of this dry glitter of vanity, out of these toilsome"
"futilities. I will go and never return. This time I will stay . . . . ."
"I swore it and when the time came—_I didn’t go_."
"“Three times in one year have I passed that door and failed to enter."
"Three times in the last year."
"“The first time was on the night of the snatch division on the Tenants’"
"Redemption Bill, on which the Government was saved by a majority of"
"three. You remember? No one on our side—perhaps very few on the"
"opposite side—expected the end that night. Then the debate collapsed"
"like eggshells. I and Hotchkiss were dining with his cousin at"
"Brentford, we were both unpaired, and we were called up by telephone,"
"and set off at once in his cousin’s motor. We got in barely in time,"
"and on the way we passed my wall and door—livid in the moonlight,"
"blotched with hot yellow as the glare of our lamps lit it, but"
"unmistakable. ‘My God!’ cried I. ‘What?’ said Hotchkiss. ‘Nothing!’ I"
"answered, and the moment passed."
"“‘I’ve made a great sacrifice,’ I told the whip as I got in. They all"
"have,’ he said, and hurried by."
"“I do not see how I could have done otherwise then. And the next"
"occasion was as I rushed to my father’s bedside to bid that stern old"
"man farewell. Then, too, the claims of life were imperative. But the"
"third time was different; it happened a week ago. It fills me with hot"
"remorse to recall it. I was with Gurker and Ralphs—it’s no secret now"
"you know that I’ve had my talk with Gurker. We had been dining at"
"Frobisher’s, and the talk had become intimate between us. The question"
"of my place in the reconstructed ministry lay always just over the"
"boundary of the discussion. Yes—yes. That’s all settled. It needn’t be"
"talked about yet, but there’s no reason to keep a secret from you . . ."
". . Yes—thanks! thanks! But let me tell you my story."
"“Then, on that night things were very much in the air. My position was"
"a very delicate one. I was keenly anxious to get some definite word"
"from Gurker, but was hampered by Ralphs’ presence. I was using the best"
"power of my brain to keep that light and careless talk not too"
"obviously directed to the point that concerns me. I had to. Ralphs’"
"behaviour since has more than justified my caution . . . . . Ralphs, I"
"knew, would leave us beyond the Kensington High Street, and then I"
"could surprise Gurker by a sudden frankness. One has sometimes to"
"resort to these little devices. . . . . And then it was that in the"
"margin of my field of vision I became aware once more of the white"
"wall, the green door before us down the road."
"“We passed it talking. I passed it. I can still see the shadow of"
"Gurker’s marked profile, his opera hat tilted forward over his"
"prominent nose, the many folds of his neck wrap going before my shadow"
"and Ralphs’ as we sauntered past."
"“I passed within twenty inches of the door. ‘If I say good-night to"
"them, and go in,’ I asked myself, ‘what will happen?’ And I was all"
"a-tingle for that word with Gurker."
"“I could not answer that question in the tangle of my other problems."
"‘They will think me mad,’ I thought. ‘And suppose I vanish now!—Amazing"
"disappearance of a prominent politician!’ That weighed with me. A"
"thousand inconceivably petty worldlinesses weighed with me in that"
"crisis.”"
"Then he turned on me with a sorrowful smile, and, speaking slowly;"
"“Here I am!” he said."
"“Here I am!” he repeated, “and my chance has gone from me. Three times"
"in one year the door has been offered me—the door that goes into peace,"
"into delight, into a beauty beyond dreaming, a kindness no man on earth"
"can know. And I have rejected it, Redmond, and it has gone—”"
"“How do you know?”"
"“I know. I know. I am left now to work it out, to stick to the tasks"
"that held me so strongly when my moments came. You say, I have"
"success—this vulgar, tawdry, irksome, envied thing. I have it.” He had"
"a walnut in his big hand. “If that was my success,” he said, and"
"crushed it, and held it out for me to see."
"“Let me tell you something, Redmond. This loss is destroying me. For"
"two months, for ten weeks nearly now, I have done no work at all,"
"except the most necessary and urgent duties. My soul is full of"
"inappeasable regrets. At nights—when it is less likely I shall be"
"recognised—I go out. I wander. Yes. I wonder what people would think of"
"that if they knew. A Cabinet Minister, the responsible head of that"
"most vital of all departments, wandering alone—grieving—sometimes near"
"audibly lamenting—for a door, for a garden!”"
"IV"
"I can see now his rather pallid face, and the unfamiliar sombre fire"
"that had come into his eyes. I see him very vividly to-night. I sit"
"recalling his words, his tones, and last evening’s _Westminster"
"Gazette_ still lies on my sofa, containing the notice of his death. At"
"lunch to-day the club was busy with him and the strange riddle of his"
"fate."
"They found his body very early yesterday morning in a deep excavation"
"near East Kensington Station. It is one of two shafts that have been"
"made in connection with an extension of the railway southward. It is"
"protected from the intrusion of the public by a hoarding upon the high"
"road, in which a small doorway has been cut for the convenience of some"
"of the workmen who live in that direction. The doorway was left"
"unfastened through a misunderstanding between two gangers, and through"
"it he made his way . . . . ."
"My mind is darkened with questions and riddles."
"It would seem he walked all the way from the House that night—he has"
"frequently walked home during the past Session—and so it is I figure"
"his dark form coming along the late and empty streets, wrapped up,"
"intent. And then did the pale electric lights near the station cheat"
"the rough planking into a semblance of white? Did that fatal unfastened"
"door awaken some memory?"
"Was there, after all, ever any green door in the wall at all?"
"I do not know. I have told his story as he told it to me. There are"
"times when I believe that Wallace was no more than the victim of the"
"coincidence between a rare but not unprecedented type of hallucination"
"and a careless trap, but that indeed is not my profoundest belief. You"
"may think me superstitious if you will, and foolish; but, indeed, I am"
"more than half convinced that he had in truth, an abnormal gift, and a"
"sense, something—I know not what—that in the guise of wall and door"
"offered him an outlet, a secret and peculiar passage of escape into"
"another and altogether more beautiful world. At any rate, you will say,"
"it betrayed him in the end. But did it betray him? There you touch the"
"inmost mystery of these dreamers, these men of vision and the"
"imagination. We see our world fair and common, the hoarding and the"
"pit. By our daylight standard he walked out of security into darkness,"
"danger and death. But did he see like that?"
"THE STAR"
"It was on the first day of the New Year that the announcement was made,"
"almost simultaneously from three observatories, that the motion of the"
"planet Neptune, the outermost of all the planets that wheel about the"
"sun, had become very erratic. Ogilvy had already called attention to a"
"suspected retardation in its velocity in December. Such a piece of news"
"was scarcely calculated to interest a world the greater portion of"
"whose inhabitants were unaware of the existence of the planet Neptune,"
"nor outside the astronomical profession did the subsequent discovery of"
"a faint remote speck of light in the region of the perturbed planet"
"cause any very great excitement. Scientific people, however, found the"
"intelligence remarkable enough, even before it became known that the"
"new body was rapidly growing larger and brighter, that its motion was"
"quite different from the orderly progress of the planets, and that the"
"deflection of Neptune and its satellite was becoming now of an"
"unprecedented kind."
"Few people without a training in science can realise the huge isolation"
"of the solar system. The sun with its specks of planets, its dust of"
"planetoids, and its impalpable comets, swims in a vacant immensity that"
"almost defeats the imagination. Beyond the orbit of Neptune there is"
"space, vacant so far as human observation has penetrated, without"
"warmth or light or sound, blank emptiness, for twenty million times a"
"million miles. That is the smallest estimate of the distance to be"
"traversed before the very nearest of the stars is attained. And, saving"
"a few comets more unsubstantial than the thinnest flame, no matter had"
"ever to human knowledge crossed this gulf of space, until early in the"
"twentieth century this strange wanderer appeared. A vast mass of matter"
"it was, bulky, heavy, rushing without warning out of the black mystery"
"of the sky into the radiance of the sun. By the second day it was"
"clearly visible to any decent instrument, as a speck with a barely"
"sensible diameter, in the constellation Leo near Regulus. In a little"
"while an opera glass could attain it."
"On the third day of the new year the newspaper readers of two"
"hemispheres were made aware for the first time of the real importance"
"of this unusual apparition in the heavens. “A Planetary Collision,” one"
"London paper headed the news, and proclaimed Duchaine’s opinion that"
"this strange new planet would probably collide with Neptune. The leader"
"writers enlarged upon the topic; so that in most of the capitals of the"
"world, on January 3rd, there was an expectation, however vague of some"
"imminent phenomenon in the sky; and as the night followed the sunset"
"round the globe, thousands of men turned their eyes skyward to see—the"
"old familiar stars just as they had always been."
"Until it was dawn in London and Pollux setting and the stars overhead"
"grown pale. The Winter’s dawn it was, a sickly filtering accumulation"
"of daylight, and the light of gas and candles shone yellow in the"
"windows to show where people were astir. But the yawning policeman saw"
"the thing, the busy crowds in the markets stopped agape, workmen going"
"to their work betimes, milkmen, the drivers of news-carts, dissipation"
"going home jaded and pale, homeless wanderers, sentinels on their"
"beats, and in the country, labourers trudging afield, poachers slinking"
"home, all over the dusky quickening country it could be seen—and out at"
"sea by seamen watching for the day—a great white star, come suddenly"
"into the westward sky!"
"Brighter it was than any star in our skies; brighter than the evening"
"star at its brightest. It still glowed out white and large, no mere"
"twinkling spot of light, but a small round clear shining disc, an hour"
"after the day had come. And where science has not reached, men stared"
"and feared, telling one another of the wars and pestilences that are"
"foreshadowed by these fiery signs in the Heavens. Sturdy Boers, dusky"
"Hottentots, Gold Coast Negroes, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Portuguese, stood"
"in the warmth of the sunrise watching the setting of this strange new"
"star."
"And in a hundred observatories there had been suppressed excitement,"
"rising almost to shouting pitch, as the two remote bodies had rushed"
"together; and a hurrying to and fro, to gather photographic apparatus"
"and spectroscope, and this appliance and that, to record this novel"
"astonishing sight, the destruction of a world. For it was a world, a"
"sister planet of our earth, far greater than our earth indeed, that had"
"so suddenly flashed into flaming death. Neptune it was, had been"
"struck, fairly and squarely, by the strange planet from outer space and"
"the heat of the concussion had incontinently turned two solid globes"
"into one vast mass of incandescence. Round the world that day, two"
"hours before the dawn, went the pallid great white star, fading only as"
"it sank westward and the sun mounted above it. Everywhere men marvelled"
"at it, but of all those who saw it none could have marvelled more than"
"those sailors, habitual watchers of the stars, who far away at sea had"
"heard nothing of its advent and saw it now rise like a pigmy moon and"
"climb zenithward and hang overhead and sink westward with the passing"
"of the night."
"And when next it rose over Europe everywhere were crowds of watchers on"
"hilly slopes, on house-roofs, in open spaces, staring eastward for the"
"rising of the great new star. It rose with a white glow in front of it,"
"like the glare of a white fire, and those who had seen it come into"
"existence the night before cried out at the sight of it. “It is"
"larger,” they cried. “It is brighter!” And, indeed the moon a quarter"
"full and sinking in the west was in its apparent size beyond"
"comparison, but scarcely in all its breadth had it as much brightness"
"now as the little circle of the strange new star."
"“It is brighter!” cried the people clustering in the streets. But in"
"the dim observatories the watchers held their breath and peered at one"
"another. “_It is nearer_,” they said. “_Nearer!_”"
"And voice after voice repeated, “It is nearer,” and the clicking"
"telegraph took that up, and it trembled along telephone wires, and in a"
"thousand cities grimy compositors fingered the type. “It is nearer.”"
"Men writing in offices, struck with a strange realisation, flung down"
"their pens, men talking in a thousand places suddenly came upon a"
"grotesque possibility in those words, “It is nearer.” It hurried along"
"wakening streets, it was shouted down the frost-stilled ways of quiet"
"villages; men who had read these things from the throbbing tape stood"
"in yellow-lit doorways shouting the news to the passersby. “It is"
"nearer.” Pretty women, flushed and glittering, heard the news told"
"jestingly between the dances, and feigned an intelligent interest they"
"did not feel. “Nearer! Indeed. How curious! How very, very clever"
"people must be to find out things like that!”"
"Lonely tramps faring through the wintry night murmured those words to"
"comfort themselves—looking skyward. “It has need to be nearer, for the"
"night’s as cold as charity. Don’t seem much warmth from it if it _is_"
"nearer, all the same.”"
"“What is a new star to me?” cried the weeping woman kneeling beside her"
"dead."
"The schoolboy, rising early for his examination work, puzzled it out"
"for himself—with the great white star shining broad and bright through"
"the frost-flowers of his window. “Centrifugal, centripetal,” he said,"
"with his chin on his fist. “Stop a planet in its flight, rob it of its"
"centrifugal force, what then? Centripetal has it, and down it falls"
"into the sun! And this—!"
"“Do _we_ come in the way? I wonder—”"
"The light of that day went the way of its brethren, and with the later"
"watches of the frosty darkness rose the strange star again. And it was"
"now so bright that the waxing moon seemed but a pale yellow ghost of"
"itself, hanging huge in the sunset. In a South African City a great man"
"had married, and the streets were alight to welcome his return with his"
"bride. “Even the skies have illuminated,” said the flatterer. Under"
"Capricorn, two negro lovers, daring the wild beasts and evil spirits,"
"for love of one another, crouched together in a cane brake where the"
"fire-flies hovered. “That is our star,” they whispered, and felt"
"strangely comforted by the sweet brilliance of its light."
"The master mathematician sat in his private room and pushed the papers"
"from him. His calculations were already finished. In a small white"
"phial there still remained a little of the drug that had kept him awake"
"and active for four long nights. Each day, serene, explicit, patient as"
"ever, he had given his lecture to his students, and then had come back"
"at once to this momentous calculation. His face was grave, a little"
"drawn and hectic from his drugged activity. For some time he seemed"
"lost in thought. Then he went to the window, and the blind went up with"
"a click. Half way up the sky, over the clustering roofs, chimneys and"
"steeples of the city, hung the star."
"He looked at it as one might look into the eyes of a brave enemy. “You"
"may kill me,” he said after a silence. “But I can hold you—and all the"
"universe for that matter—in the grip of this little brain. I would not"
"change. Even now.”"
"He looked at the little phial. “There will be no need of sleep again,”"
"he said. The next day at noon—punctual to the minute, he entered his"
"lecture theatre, put his hat on the end of the table as his habit was,"
"and carefully selected a large piece of chalk. It was a joke among his"
"students that he could not lecture without that piece of chalk to"
"fumble in his fingers, and once he had been stricken to impotence by"
"their hiding his supply. He came and looked under his grey eyebrows at"
"the rising tiers of young fresh faces, and spoke with his accustomed"
"studied commonness of phrasing. “Circumstances have"
"arisen—circumstances beyond my control,” he said and paused, “which"
"will debar me from completing the course I had designed. It would seem,"
"gentlemen, if I may put the thing clearly and briefly, that—Man has"
"lived in vain.”"
"The students glanced at one another. Had they heard aright? Mad? Raised"
"eyebrows and grinning lips there were, but one or two faces remained"
"intent upon his calm grey-fringed face. “It will be interesting,” he"
"was saying, “to devote this morning to an exposition, so far as I can"
"make it clear to you, of the calculations that have led me to this"
"conclusion. Let us assume—”"
"He turned towards the blackboard, meditating a diagram in the way that"
"was usual to him. “What was that about ‘lived in vain?’” whispered one"
"student to another. “Listen,” said the other, nodding towards the"
"lecturer."
"And presently they began to understand."
"That night the star rose later, for its proper eastward motion had"
"carried it some way across Leo towards Virgo, and its brightness was so"
"great that the sky became a luminous blue as it rose, and every star"
"was hidden in its turn, save only Jupiter near the zenith, Capella,"
"Aldebaran, Sirius and the pointers of the Bear. It was very white and"
"beautiful. In many parts of the world that night a pallid halo"
"encircled it about. It was perceptibly larger; in the clear refractive"
"sky of the tropics it seemed as if it were nearly a quarter the size of"
"the moon. The frost was still on the ground in England, but the world"
"was as brightly lit as if it were midsummer moonlight. One could see to"
"read quite ordinary print by that cold clear light, and in the cities"
"the lamps burnt yellow and wan."
"And everywhere the world was awake that night, and throughout"
"Christendom a sombre murmur hung in the keen air over the country side"
"like the belling of bees in the heather, and this murmurous tumult grew"
"to a clangour in the cities. It was the tolling of the bells in a"
"million belfry towers and steeples, summoning the people to sleep no"
"more, to sin no more, but to gather in their churches and pray. And"
"overhead, growing larger and brighter as the earth rolled on its way"
"and the night passed, rose the dazzling star."
"And the streets and houses were alight in all the cities, the shipyards"
"glared, and whatever roads led to high country were lit and crowded all"
"night long. And in all the seas about the civilised lands, ships with"
"throbbing engines, and ships with bellying sails, crowded with men and"
"living creatures, were standing out to ocean and the north. For already"
"the warning of the master mathematician had been telegraphed all over"
"the world, and translated into a hundred tongues. The new planet and"
"Neptune, locked in a fiery embrace, were whirling headlong, ever faster"
"and faster towards the sun. Already every second this blazing mass flew"
"a hundred miles, and every second its terrific velocity increased. As"
"it flew now, indeed, it must pass a hundred million of miles wide of"
"the earth and scarcely affect it. But near its destined path, as yet"
"only slightly perturbed, spun the mighty planet Jupiter and his moons"
"sweeping splendid round the sun. Every moment now the attraction"
"between the fiery star and the greatest of the planets grew stronger."
"And the result of that attraction? Inevitably Jupiter would be"
"deflected from its orbit into an elliptical path, and the burning star,"
"swung by his attraction wide of its sunward rush, would “describe a"
"curved path” and perhaps collide with, and certainly pass very close"
"to, our earth. “Earthquakes, volcanic outbreaks, cyclones, sea waves,"
"floods, and a steady rise in temperature to I know not what limit”—so"
"prophesied the master mathematician."
"And overhead, to carry out his words, lonely and cold and livid, blazed"
"the star of the coming doom."
"To many who stared at it that night until their eyes ached, it seemed"
"that it was visibly approaching. And that night, too, the weather"
"changed, and the frost that had gripped all Central Europe and France"
"and England softened towards a thaw."
"But you must not imagine because I have spoken of people praying"
"through the night and people going aboard ships and people fleeing"
"toward mountainous country that the whole world was already in a terror"
"because of the star. As a matter of fact, use and wont still ruled the"
"world, and save for the talk of idle moments and the splendour of the"
"night, nine human beings out of ten were still busy at their common"
"occupations. In all the cities the shops, save one here and there,"
"opened and closed at their proper hours, the doctor and the undertaker"
"plied their trades, the workers gathered in the factories, soldiers"
"drilled, scholars studied, lovers sought one another, thieves lurked"
"and fled, politicians planned their schemes. The presses of the"
"newspapers roared through the night, and many a priest of this church"
"and that would not open his holy building to further what he considered"
"a foolish panic. The newspapers insisted on the lesson of the year"
"1000—for then, too, people had anticipated the end. The star was no"
"star—mere gas—a comet; and were it a star it could not possibly strike"
"the earth. There was no precedent for such a thing. Common sense was"
"sturdy everywhere, scornful, jesting, a little inclined to persecute"
"the obdurate fearful. That night, at seven-fifteen by Greenwich time,"
"the star would be at its nearest to Jupiter. Then the world would see"
"the turn things would take. The master mathematician’s grim warnings"
"were treated by many as so much mere elaborate self-advertisement."
"Common sense at last, a little heated by argument, signified its"
"unalterable convictions by going to bed. So, too, barbarism and"
"savagery, already tired of the novelty, went about their nightly"
"business, and save for a howling dog here and there, the beast world"
"left the star unheeded."
"And yet, when at last the watchers in the European States saw the star"
"rise, an hour later it is true, but no larger than it had been the"
"night before, there were still plenty awake to laugh at the master"
"mathematician—to take the danger as if it had passed."
"But hereafter the laughter ceased. The star grew—it grew with a"
"terrible steadiness hour after hour, a little larger each hour, a"
"little nearer the midnight zenith, and brighter and brighter, until it"
"had turned night into a second day. Had it come straight to the earth"
"instead of in a curved path, had it lost no velocity to Jupiter, it"
"must have leapt the intervening gulf in a day, but as it was it took"
"five days altogether to come by our planet. The next night it had"
"become a third the size of the moon before it set to English eyes, and"
"the thaw was assured. It rose over America near the size of the moon,"
"but blinding white to look at, and _hot_; and a breath of hot wind blew"
"now with its rising and gathering strength, and in Virginia, and"
"Brazil, and down the St. Lawrence valley, it shone intermittently"
"through a driving reek of thunder-clouds, flickering violet lightning,"
"and hail unprecedented. In Manitoba was a thaw and devastating floods."
"And upon all the mountains of the earth the snow and ice began to melt"
"that night, and all the rivers coming out of high country flowed thick"
"and turbid, and soon—in their upper reaches—with swirling trees and the"
"bodies of beasts and men. They rose steadily, steadily in the ghostly"
"brilliance, and came trickling over their banks at last, behind the"
"flying population of their valleys."
"And along the coast of Argentina and up the South Atlantic the tides"
"were higher than had ever been in the memory of man, and the storms"
"drove the waters in many cases scores of miles inland, drowning whole"
"cities. And so great grew the heat during the night that the rising of"
"the sun was like the coming of a shadow. The earthquakes began and grew"
"until all down America from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, hillsides"
"were sliding, fissures were opening, and houses and walls crumbling to"
"destruction. The whole side of Cotopaxi slipped out in one vast"
"convulsion, and a tumult of lava poured out so high and broad and swift"
"and liquid that in one day it reached the sea."
"So the star, with the wan moon in its wake, marched across the Pacific,"
"trailed the thunderstorms like the hem of a robe, and the growing tidal"
"wave that toiled behind it, frothing and eager, poured over island and"
"island and swept them clear of men. Until that wave came at last—in a"
"blinding light and with the breath of a furnace, swift and terrible it"
"came—a wall of water, fifty feet high, roaring hungrily, upon the long"
"coasts of Asia, and swept inland across the plains of China. For a"
"space the star, hotter now and larger and brighter than the sun in its"
"strength, showed with pitiless brilliance the wide and populous"
"country; towns and villages with their pagodas and trees, roads, wide"
"cultivated fields, millions of sleepless people staring in helpless"
"terror at the incandescent sky; and then, low and growing, came the"
"murmur of the flood. And thus it was with millions of men that night—a"
"flight nowhither, with limbs heavy with heat and breath fierce and"
"scant, and the flood like a wall swift and white behind. And then"
"death."
"China was lit glowing white, but over Japan and Java and all the"
"islands of Eastern Asia the great star was a ball of dull red fire"
"because of the steam and smoke and ashes the volcanoes were spouting"
"forth to salute its coming. Above was the lava, hot gases and ash, and"
"below the seething floods, and the whole earth swayed and rumbled with"
"the earthquake shocks. Soon the immemorial snows of Thibet and the"
"Himalaya were melting and pouring down by ten million deepening"
"converging channels upon the plains of Burmah and Hindostan. The"
"tangled summits of the Indian jungles were aflame in a thousand places,"
"and below the hurrying waters around the stems were dark objects that"
"still struggled feebly and reflected the blood-red tongues of fire. And"
"in a rudderless confusion a multitude of men and women fled down the"
"broad river-ways to that one last hope of men—the open sea."
"Larger grew the star, and larger, hotter, and brighter with a terrible"
"swiftness now. The tropical ocean had lost its phosphorescence, and the"
"whirling steam rose in ghostly wreaths from the black waves that"
"plunged incessantly, speckled with storm-tossed ships."
"And then came a wonder. It seemed to those who in Europe watched for"
"the rising of the star that the world must have ceased its rotation. In"
"a thousand open spaces of down and upland the people who had fled"
"thither from the floods and the falling houses and sliding slopes of"
"hill watched for that rising in vain. Hour followed hour through a"
"terrible suspense, and the star rose not. Once again men set their eyes"
"upon the old constellations they had counted lost to them forever. In"
"England it was hot and clear overhead, though the ground quivered"
"perpetually, but in the tropics, Sirius and Capella and Aldebaran"
"showed through a veil of steam. And when at last the great star rose"
"near ten hours late, the sun rose close upon it, and in the centre of"
"its white heart was a disc of black."
"Over Asia it was the star had begun to fall behind the movement of the"
"sky, and then suddenly, as it hung over India, its light had been"
"veiled. All the plain of India from the mouth of the Indus to the"
"mouths of the Ganges was a shallow waste of shining water that night,"
"out of which rose temples and palaces, mounds and hills, black with"
"people. Every minaret was a clustering mass of people, who fell one by"
"one into the turbid waters, as heat and terror overcame them. The whole"
"land seemed a-wailing and suddenly there swept a shadow across that"
"furnace of despair, and a breath of cold wind, and a gathering of"
"clouds, out of the cooling air. Men looking up, near blinded, at the"
"star, saw that a black disc was creeping across the light. It was the"
"moon, coming between the star and the earth. And even as men cried to"
"God at this respite, out of the East with a strange inexplicable"
"swiftness sprang the sun. And then star, sun and moon rushed together"
"across the heavens."
"So it was that presently, to the European watchers, star and sun rose"
"close upon each other, drove headlong for a space and then slower, and"
"at last came to rest, star and sun merged into one glare of flame at"
"the zenith of the sky. The moon no longer eclipsed the star but was"
"lost to sight in the brilliance of the sky. And though those who were"
"still alive regarded it for the most part with that dull stupidity that"
"hunger, fatigue, heat and despair engender, there were still men who"
"could perceive the meaning of these signs. Star and earth had been at"
"their nearest, had swung about one another, and the star had passed."
"Already it was receding, swifter and swifter, in the last stage of its"
"headlong journey downward into the sun."
"And then the clouds gathered, blotting out the vision of the sky, the"
"thunder and lightning wove a garment round the world; all over the"
"earth was such a downpour of rain as men had never before seen, and"
"where the volcanoes flared red against the cloud canopy there descended"
"torrents of mud. Everywhere the waters were pouring off the land,"
"leaving mud-silted ruins, and the earth littered like a storm-worn"
"beach with all that had floated, and the dead bodies of the men and"
"brutes, its children. For days the water streamed off the land,"
"sweeping away soil and trees and houses in the way, and piling huge"
"dykes and scooping out Titanic gullies over the country side. Those"
"were the days of darkness that followed the star and the heat. All"
"through them, and for many weeks and months, the earthquakes continued."
"But the star had passed, and men, hunger-driven and gathering courage"
"only slowly, might creep back to their ruined cities, buried granaries,"
"and sodden fields. Such few ships as had escaped the storms of that"
"time came stunned and shattered and sounding their way cautiously"
"through the new marks and shoals of once familiar ports. And as the"
"storms subsided men perceived that everywhere the days were hotter than"
"of yore, and the sun larger, and the moon, shrunk to a third of its"
"former size, took now fourscore days between its new and new."
"But of the new brotherhood that grew presently among men, of the saving"
"of laws and books and machines, of the strange change that had come"
"over Iceland and Greenland and the shores of Baffin’s Bay, so that the"
"sailors coming there presently found them green and gracious, and could"
"scarce believe their eyes, this story does not tell. Nor of the"
"movement of mankind now that the earth was hotter, northward and"
"southward towards the poles of the earth. It concerns itself only with"
"the coming and the passing of the Star."
"The Martian astronomers—for there are astronomers on Mars, although"
"they are very different beings from men—were naturally profoundly"
"interested by these things. They saw them from their own standpoint of"
"course. “Considering the mass and temperature of the missile that was"
"flung through our solar system into the sun,” one wrote, “it is"
"astonishing what a little damage the earth, which it missed so"
"narrowly, has sustained. All the familiar continental markings and the"
"masses of the seas remain intact, and indeed the only difference seems"
"to be a shrinkage of the white discoloration (supposed to be frozen"
"water) round either pole.” Which only shows how small the vastest of"
"human catastrophes may seem, at a distance of a few million miles."
"A DREAM OF ARMAGEDDON"
"The man with the white face entered the carriage at Rugby. He moved"
"slowly in spite of the urgency of his porter, and even while he was"
"still on the platform I noted how ill he seemed. He dropped into the"
"corner over against me with a sigh, made an incomplete attempt to"
"arrange his travelling shawl, and became motionless, with his eyes"
"staring vacantly. Presently he was moved by a sense of my observation,"
"looked up at me, and put out a spiritless hand for his newspaper. Then"
"he glanced again in my direction."
"I feigned to read. I feared I had unwittingly embarrassed him, and in a"
"moment I was surprised to find him speaking."
"“I beg your pardon?” said I."
"“That book,” he repeated, pointing a lean finger, “is about dreams.”"
"“Obviously,” I answered, for it was Fortnum Roscoe’s Dream States, and"
"the title was on the cover."
"He hung silent for a space as if he sought words. “Yes,” he said at"
"last, “but they tell you nothing.”"
"I did not catch his meaning for a second."
"“They don’t know,” he added."
"I looked a little more attentively at his face."
"“There are dreams,” he said, “and dreams.”"
"That sort of proposition I never dispute."
"“I suppose—” he hesitated. “Do you ever dream? I mean vividly.”"
"“I dream very little,” I answered. “I doubt if I have three vivid"
"dreams in a year.”"
"“Ah!” he said, and seemed for a moment to collect his thoughts."
"“Your dreams don’t mix with your memories?” he asked abruptly. “You"
"don’t find yourself in doubt; did this happen or did it not?”"
"“Hardly ever. Except just for a momentary hesitation now and then. I"
"suppose few people do.”"
"“Does he say—?” He indicated the book."
"“Says it happens at times and gives the usual explanation about"
"intensity of impression and the like to account for its not happening"
"as a rule. I suppose you know something of these theories—”"
"“Very little—except that they are wrong.”"
"His emaciated hand played with the strap of the window for a time. I"
"prepared to resume reading, and that seemed to precipitate his next"
"remark. He leant forward almost as though he would touch me."
"“Isn’t there something called consecutive dreaming—that goes on night"
"after night?”"
"“I believe there is. There are cases given in most books on mental"
"trouble.”"
"“Mental trouble! Yes. I daresay there are. It’s the right place for"
"them. But what I mean—” He looked at his bony knuckles. “Is that sort"
"of thing always dreaming? Is it dreaming? Or is it something else?"
"Mightn’t it be something else?”"
"I should have snubbed his persistent conversation but for the drawn"
"anxiety of his face. I remember now the look of his faded eyes and the"
"lids red stained—perhaps you know that look."
"“I’m not just arguing about a matter of opinion,” he said. “The thing’s"
"killing me.”"
"“Dreams?”"
"“If you call them dreams. Night after night. Vivid!—so vivid . . . ."
"this—” (he indicated the landscape that went streaming by the window)"
"“seems unreal in comparison! I can scarcely remember who I am, what"
"business I am on . . . .”"
"He paused. “Even now—”"
"“The dream is always the same—do you mean?” I asked."
"“It’s over.”"
"“You mean?”"
"“I died.”"
"“Died?”"
"“Smashed and killed, and now, so much of me as that dream was, is dead."
"Dead forever. I dreamt I was another man, you know, living in a"
"different part of the world and in a different time. I dreamt that"
"night after night. Night after night I woke into that other life. Fresh"
"scenes and fresh happenings—until I came upon the last—”"
"“When you died?”"
"“When I died.”"
"“And since then—”"
"“No,” he said. “Thank God! That was the end of the dream . . .”"
"It was clear I was in for this dream. And after all, I had an hour"
"before me, the light was fading fast, and Fortnum Roscoe has a dreary"
"way with him. “Living in a different time,” I said: “do you mean in"
"some different age?”"
"“Yes.”"
"“Past?”"
"“No, to come—to come.”"
"“The year three thousand, for example?”"
"“I don’t know what year it was. I did when I was asleep, when I was"
"dreaming, that is, but not now—not now that I am awake. There’s a lot"
"of things I have forgotten since I woke out of these dreams, though I"
"knew them at the time when I was—I suppose it was dreaming. They called"
"the year differently from our way of calling the year . . . What did"
"they call it?” He put his hand to his forehead. “No,” said he, “I"
"forget.”"
"He sat smiling weakly. For a moment I feared he did not mean to tell me"
"his dream. As a rule I hate people who tell their dreams, but this"
"struck me differently. I proffered assistance even. “It began—” I"
"suggested."
"“It was vivid from the first. I seemed to wake up in it suddenly. And"
"it’s curious that in these dreams I am speaking of I never remembered"
"this life I am living now. It seemed as if the dream life was enough"
"while it lasted. Perhaps—But I will tell you how I find myself when I"
"do my best to recall it all. I don’t remember anything clearly until I"
"found myself sitting in a sort of loggia looking out over the sea. I"
"had been dozing, and suddenly I woke up—fresh and vivid—not a bit"
"dreamlike—because the girl had stopped fanning me.”"
"“The girl?”"
"“Yes, the girl. You must not interrupt or you will put me out.”"
"He stopped abruptly. “You won’t think I’m mad?” he said."
"“No,” I answered. “You’ve been dreaming. Tell me your dream.”"
"“I woke up, I say, because the girl had stopped fanning me. I was not"
"surprised to find myself there or anything of that sort, you"
"understand. I did not feel I had fallen into it suddenly. I simply took"
"it up at that point. Whatever memory I had of this life, this"
"nineteenth-century life, faded as I woke, vanished like a dream. I knew"
"all about myself, knew that my name was no longer Cooper but Hedon, and"
"all about my position in the world. I’ve forgotten a lot since I"
"woke—there’s a want of connection—but it was all quite clear and matter"
"of fact then.”"
"He hesitated again, gripping the window strap, putting his face forward"
"and looking up to me appealingly."
"“This seems bosh to you?”"
"“No, no!” I cried. “Go on. Tell me what this loggia was like!”"
"“It was not really a loggia—I don’t know what to call it. It faced"
"south. It was small. It was all in shadow except the semicircle above"
"the balcony that showed the sky and sea and the corner where the girl"
"stood. I was on a couch—it was a metal couch with light striped"
"cushions—and the girl was leaning over the balcony with her back to me."
"The light of the sunrise fell on her ear and cheek. Her pretty white"
"neck and the little curls that nestled there, and her white shoulder"
"were in the sun, and all the grace of her body was in the cool blue"
"shadow. She was dressed—how can I describe it? It was easy and flowing."
"And altogether there she stood, so that it came to me how beautiful and"
"desirable she was, as though I had never seen her before. And when at"
"last I sighed and raised myself upon my arm she turned her face to me—”"
"He stopped."
"“I have lived three-and-fifty years in this world. I have had mother,"
"sisters, friends, wife and daughters—all their faces, the play of their"
"faces, I know. But the face of this girl—it is much more real to me. I"
"can bring it back into memory so that I see it again—I could draw it or"
"paint it. And after all—”"
"He stopped—but I said nothing."
"“The face of a dream—the face of a dream. She was beautiful. Not that"
"beauty which is terrible, cold, and worshipful, like the beauty of a"
"saint; nor that beauty that stirs fierce passions; but a sort of"
"radiation, sweet lips that softened into smiles, and grave gray eyes."
"And she moved gracefully, she seemed to have part with all pleasant and"
"gracious things—”"
"He stopped, and his face was downcast and hidden. Then he looked up at"
"me and went on, making no further attempt to disguise his absolute"
"belief in the reality of his story."
"“You see, I had thrown up my plans and ambitions, thrown up all I had"
"ever worked for or desired for her sake. I had been a master man away"
"there in the north, with influence and property and a great reputation,"
"but none of it had seemed worth having beside her. I had come to the"
"place, this city of sunny pleasures with her, and left all those things"
"to wreck and ruin just to save a remnant at least of my life. While I"
"had been in love with her before I knew that she had any care for me,"
"before I had imagined that she would dare—that we should dare, all my"
"life had seemed vain and hollow, dust and ashes. It was dust and ashes."
"Night after night and through the long days I had longed and desired—my"
"soul had beaten against the thing forbidden!"
"“But it is impossible for one man to tell another just these things."
"It’s emotion, it’s a tint, a light that comes and goes. Only while it’s"
"there, everything changes, everything. The thing is I came away and"
"left them in their Crisis to do what they could.”"
"“Left whom?” I asked, puzzled."
"“The people up in the north there. You see—in this dream, anyhow—I had"
"been a big man, the sort of man men come to trust in, to group"
"themselves about. Millions of men who had never seen me were ready to"
"do things and risk things because of their confidence in me. I had been"
"playing that game for years, that big laborious game, that vague,"
"monstrous political game amidst intrigues and betrayals, speech and"
"agitation. It was a vast weltering world, and at last I had a sort of"
"leadership against the Gang—you know it was called the Gang—a sort of"
"compromise of scoundrelly projects and base ambitions and vast public"
"emotional stupidities and catch-words—the Gang that kept the world"
"noisy and blind year by year, and all the while that it was drifting,"
"drifting towards infinite disaster. But I can’t expect you to"
"understand the shades and complications of the year—the year something"
"or other ahead. I had it all—down to the smallest details—in my dream."
"I suppose I had been dreaming of it before I awoke, and the fading"
"outline of some queer new development I had imagined still hung about"
"me as I rubbed my eyes. It was some grubby affair that made me thank"
"God for the sunlight. I sat up on the couch and remained looking at the"
"woman and rejoicing—rejoicing that I had come away out of all that"
"tumult and folly and violence before it was too late. After all, I"
"thought, this is life—love and beauty, desire and delight, are they not"
"worth all those dismal struggles for vague, gigantic ends? And I blamed"
"myself for having ever sought to be a leader when I might have given my"
"days to love. But then, thought I, if I had not spent my early days"
"sternly and austerely, I might have wasted myself upon vain and"
"worthless women, and at the thought all my being went out in love and"
"tenderness to my dear mistress, my dear lady, who had come at last and"
"compelled me—compelled me by her invincible charm for me—to lay that"
"life aside."
"“‘You are worth it,’ I said, speaking without intending her to hear;"
"‘you are worth it, my dearest one; worth pride and praise and all"
"things. Love! to have you is worth them all together.’ And at the"
"murmur of my voice she turned about."
"“‘Come and see,’ she cried—I can hear her now—‘come and see the sunrise"
"upon Monte Solaro.’"
"“I remember how I sprang to my feet and joined her at the balcony. She"
"put a white hand upon my shoulder and pointed towards great masses of"
"limestone, flushing, as it were, into life. I looked. But first I noted"
"the sunlight on her face caressing the lines of her cheeks and neck."
"How can I describe to you the scene we had before us? We were at"
"Capri—”"
"“I have been there,” I said. “I have clambered up Monte Solaro and"
"drunk vero Capri—muddy stuff like cider—at the summit.”"
"“Ah!” said the man with the white face; “then perhaps you can tell"
"me—you will know if this is indeed Capri. For in this life I have never"
"been there. Let me describe it. We were in a little room, one of a vast"
"multitude of little rooms, very cool and sunny, hollowed out of the"
"limestone of a sort of cape, very high above the sea. The whole island,"
"you know, was one enormous hotel, complex beyond explaining, and on the"
"other side there were miles of floating hotels, and huge floating"
"stages to which the flying machines came. They called it a pleasure"
"city. Of course, there was none of that in your time—rather, I should"
"say, is none of that now. Of course. Now!—yes."
"“Well, this room of ours was at the extremity of the cape, so that one"
"could see east and west. Eastward was a great cliff—a thousand feet"
"high perhaps—coldly gray except for one bright edge of gold, and beyond"
"it the Isle of the Sirens, and a falling coast that faded and passed"
"into the hot sunrise. And when one turned to the west, distinct and"
"near was a little bay, a little beach still in shadow. And out of that"
"shadow rose Solaro straight and tall, flushed and golden crested, like"
"a beauty throned, and the white moon was floating behind her in the"
"sky. And before us from east to west stretched the many-tinted sea all"
"dotted with little sailing boats."
"“To the eastward, of course, these little boats were gray and very"
"minute and clear, but to the westward they were little boats of"
"gold—shining gold—almost like little flames. And just below us was a"
"rock with an arch worn through it. The blue sea-water broke to green"
"and foam all round the rock, and a galley came gliding out of the"
"arch.”"
"“I know that rock.” I said. “I was nearly drowned there. It is called"
"the Faraglioni.”"
"“I Faraglioni? Yes, she called it that,” answered the man with the"
"white face. “There was some story—but that—”"
"He put his hand to his forehead again. “No,” he said, “I forget that"
"story.”"
"“Well, that is the first thing I remember, the first dream I had, that"
"little shaded room and the beautiful air and sky and that dear lady of"
"mine, with her shining arms and her graceful robe, and how we sat and"
"talked in half whispers to one another. We talked in whispers not"
"because there was any one to hear, but because there was still such a"
"freshness of mind between us that our thoughts were a little"
"frightened, I think, to find themselves at last in words. And so they"
"went softly."
"“Presently we were hungry and we went from our apartment, going by a"
"strange passage with a moving floor, until we came to the great"
"breakfast room—there was a fountain and music. A pleasant and joyful"
"place it was, with its sunlight and splashing, and the murmur of"
"plucked strings. And we sat and ate and smiled at one another, and I"
"would not heed a man who was watching me from a table near by."
"“And afterwards we went on to the dancing-hall. But I cannot describe"
"that hall. The place was enormous—larger than any building you have"
"ever seen—and in one place there was the old gate of Capri, caught into"
"the wall of a gallery high overhead. Light girders, stems and threads"
"of gold, burst from the pillars like fountains, streamed like an Aurora"
"across the roof and interlaced, like—like conjuring tricks. All about"
"the great circle for the dancers there were beautiful figures, strange"
"dragons, and intricate and wonderful grotesques bearing lights. The"
"place was inundated with artificial light that shamed the newborn day."
"And as we went through the throng the people turned about and looked at"
"us, for all through the world my name and face were known, and how I"
"had suddenly thrown up pride and struggle to come to this place. And"
"they looked also at the lady beside me, though half the story of how at"
"last she had come to me was unknown or mistold. And few of the men who"
"were there, I know, but judged me a happy man, in spite of all the"
"shame and dishonour that had come upon my name."
"“The air was full of music, full of harmonious scents, full of the"
"rhythm of beautiful motions. Thousands of beautiful people swarmed"
"about the hall, crowded the galleries, sat in a myriad recesses; they"
"were dressed in splendid colours and crowned with flowers; thousands"
"danced about the great circle beneath the white images of the ancient"
"gods, and glorious processions of youths and maidens came and went. We"
"two danced, not the dreary monotonies of your days—of this time, I"
"mean—but dances that were beautiful, intoxicating. And even now I can"
"see my lady dancing—dancing joyously. She danced, you know, with a"
"serious face; she danced with a serious dignity, and yet she was"
"smiling at me and caressing me—smiling and caressing with her eyes."
"“The music was different,” he murmured. “It went—I cannot describe it;"
"but it was infinitely richer and more varied than any music that has"
"ever come to me awake."
"“And then—it was when we had done dancing—a man came to speak to me. He"
"was a lean, resolute man, very soberly clad for that place, and already"
"I had marked his face watching me in the breakfasting hall, and"
"afterwards as we went along the passage I had avoided his eye. But now,"
"as we sat in a little alcove, smiling at the pleasure of all the people"
"who went to and fro across the shining floor, he came and touched me,"
"and spoke to me so that I was forced to listen. And he asked that he"
"might speak to me for a little time apart."
"“‘No,’ I said. ‘I have no secrets from this lady. What do you want to"
"tell me?’"
"“He said it was a trivial matter, or at least a dry matter, for a lady"
"to hear."
"“‘Perhaps for me to hear,’ said I."
"“He glanced at her, as though almost he would appeal to her. Then he"
"asked me suddenly if I had heard of a great and avenging declaration"
"that Evesham had made? Now, Evesham had always before been the man next"
"to myself in the leadership of that great party in the north. He was a"
"forcible, hard, and tactless man, and only I had been able to control"
"and soften him. It was on his account even more than my own, I think,"
"that the others had been so dismayed at my retreat. So this question"
"about what he had done reawakened my old interest in the life I had put"
"aside just for a moment."
"“‘I have taken no heed of any news for many days,’ I said. What has"
"Evesham been saying?’"
"“And with that the man began, nothing loth, and I must confess even I"
"was struck by Evesham’s reckless folly in the wild and threatening"
"words he had used. And this messenger they had sent to me not only told"
"me of Evesham’s speech, but went on to ask counsel and to point out"
"what need they had of me. While he talked, my lady sat a little forward"
"and watched his face and mine."
"“My old habits of scheming and organising reasserted themselves. I"
"could even see myself suddenly returning to the north, and all the"
"dramatic effect of it. All that this man said witnessed to the disorder"
"of the party indeed, but not to its damage. I should go back stronger"
"than I had come. And then I thought of my lady. You see—how can I tell"
"you? There were certain peculiarities of our relationship—as things are"
"I need not tell you about that—which would render her presence with me"
"impossible. I should have had to leave her; indeed, I should have had"
"to renounce her clearly and openly, if I was to do all that I could do"
"in the north. And the man knew that, even as he talked to her and me,"
"knew it as well as she did, that my steps to duty were—first,"
"separation, then abandonment. At the touch of that thought my dream of"
"a return was shattered. I turned on the man suddenly, as he was"
"imagining his eloquence was gaining ground with me."
"“‘What have I to do with these things now?’ I said. ‘I have done with"
"them. Do you think I am coquetting with your people in coming here?’"
"“‘No,’ he said. ‘But—’"
"“‘Why cannot you leave me alone. I have done with these things. I have"
"ceased to be anything but a private man.’"
"“‘Yes,’ he answered. ‘But have you thought?—this talk of war, these"
"reckless challenges, these wild aggressions—’"
"“I stood up."
"“‘No,’ I cried. ‘I won’t hear you. I took count of all those things, I"
"weighed them—and I have come away.’"
"“He seemed to consider the possibility of persistence. He looked from"
"me to where the lady sat regarding us."
"“‘War,’ he said, as if he were speaking to himself, and then turned"
"slowly from me and walked away."
"“I stood, caught in the whirl of thoughts his appeal had set going."
"“I heard my lady’s voice."
"“‘Dear,’ she said; ‘but if they had need of you—’"
"“She did not finish her sentence, she let it rest there. I turned to"
"her sweet face, and the balance of my mood swayed and reeled."
"“‘They want me only to do the thing they dare not do themselves,’ I"
"said. ‘If they distrust Evesham they must settle with him themselves.’"
"“She looked at me doubtfully."
"“‘But war—’ she said."
"“I saw a doubt on her face that I had seen before, a doubt of herself"
"and me, the first shadow of the discovery that, seen strongly and"
"completely, must drive us apart for ever."
"“Now, I was an older mind than hers, and I could sway her to this"
"belief or that."
"“‘My dear one,’ I said, ‘you must not trouble over these things. There"
"will be no war. Certainly there will be no war. The age of wars is"
"past. Trust me to know the justice of this case. They have no right"
"upon me, dearest, and no one has a right upon me. I have been free to"
"choose my life, and I have chosen this.’"
"“‘But war—,’ she said."
"“I sat down beside her. I put an arm behind her and took her hand in"
"mine. I set myself to drive that doubt away—I set myself to fill her"
"mind with pleasant things again. I lied to her, and in lying to her I"
"lied also to myself. And she was only too ready to believe me, only too"
"ready to forget."
"“Very soon the shadow had gone again, and we were hastening to our"
"bathing-place in the Grotta del Bovo Marino, where it was our custom to"
"bathe every day. We swam and splashed one another, and in that buoyant"
"water I seemed to become something lighter and stronger than a man. And"
"at last we came out dripping and rejoicing and raced among the rocks."
"And then I put on a dry bathing-dress, and we sat to bask in the sun,"
"and presently I nodded, resting my head against her knee, and she put"
"her hand upon my hair and stroked it softly and I dozed. And behold! as"
"it were with the snapping of the string of a violin, I was awakening,"
"and I was in my own bed in Liverpool, in the life of to-day."
"“Only for a time I could not believe that all these vivid moments had"
"been no more than the substance of a dream."
"“In truth, I could not believe it a dream for all the sobering reality"
"of things about me. I bathed and dressed as it were by habit, and as I"
"shaved I argued why I of all men should leave the woman I loved to go"
"back to fantastic politics in the hard and strenuous north. Even if"
"Evesham did force the world back to war, what was that to me? I was a"
"man with the heart of a man, and why should I feel the responsibility"
"of a deity for the way the world might go?"
"“You know that is not quite the way I think about affairs, about my"
"real affairs. I am a solicitor, you know, with a point of view."
"“The vision was so real, you must understand, so utterly unlike a dream"
"that I kept perpetually recalling little irrelevant details; even the"
"ornament of the book-cover that lay on my wife’s sewing-machine in the"
"breakfast-room recalled with the utmost vividness the gilt line that"
"ran about the seat in the alcove where I had talked with the messenger"
"from my deserted party. Have you ever heard of a dream that had a"
"quality like that?”"
"“Like—?”"
"“So that afterwards you remembered little details you had forgotten.”"
"I thought. I had never noticed the point before, but he was right."
"“Never,” I said. “That is what you never seem to do with dreams.”"
"“No,” he answered. “But that is just what I did. I am a solicitor, you"
"must understand, in Liverpool, and I could not help wondering what the"
"clients and business people I found myself talking to in my office"
"would think if I told them suddenly I was in love with a girl who would"
"be born a couple of hundred years or so hence, and worried about the"
"politics of my great-great-great-grandchildren. I was chiefly busy that"
"day negotiating a ninety-nine-year building lease. It was a private"
"builder in a hurry, and we wanted to tie him in every possible way. I"
"had an interview with him, and he showed a certain want of temper that"
"sent me to bed still irritated. That night I had no dream. Nor did I"
"dream the next night, at least, to remember."
"“Something of that intense reality of conviction vanished. I began to"
"feel sure it was a dream. And then it came again."
"“When the dream came again, nearly four days later, it was very"
"different. I think it certain that four days had also elapsed in the"
"dream. Many things had happened in the north, and the shadow of them"
"was back again between us, and this time it was not so easily"
"dispelled. I began I know with moody musings. Why, in spite of all,"
"should I go back, go back for all the rest of my days to toil and"
"stress, insults and perpetual dissatisfaction, simply to save hundreds"
"of millions of common people, whom I did not love, whom too often I"
"could do no other than despise, from the stress and anguish of war and"
"infinite misrule? And after all I might fail. They all sought their own"
"narrow ends, and why should not I—why should not I also live as a man?"
"And out of such thoughts her voice summoned me, and I lifted my eyes."
"“I found myself awake and walking. We had come out above the Pleasure"
"City, we were near the summit of Monte Solaro and looking towards the"
"bay. It was the late afternoon and very clear. Far away to the left"
"Ischia hung in a golden haze between sea and sky, and Naples was coldly"
"white against the hills, and before us was Vesuvius with a tall and"
"slender streamer feathering at last towards the south, and the ruins of"
"Torre dell’ Annunziata and Castellammare glittering and near.”"
"I interrupted suddenly: “You have been to Capri, of course?”"
"“Only in this dream,” he said, “only in this dream. All across the bay"
"beyond Sorrento were the floating palaces of the Pleasure City moored"
"and chained. And northward were the broad floating stages that received"
"the aeroplanes. Aeroplanes fell out of the sky every afternoon, each"
"bringing its thousands of pleasure-seekers from the uttermost parts of"
"the earth to Capri and its delights. All these things, I say, stretched"
"below."
"“But we noticed them only incidentally because of an unusual sight that"
"evening had to show. Five war aeroplanes that had long slumbered"
"useless in the distant arsenals of the Rhinemouth were manoeuvring now"
"in the eastward sky. Evesham had astonished the world by producing them"
"and others, and sending them to circle here and there. It was the"
"threat material in the great game of bluff he was playing, and it had"
"taken even me by surprise. He was one of those incredibly stupid"
"energetic people who seem sent by heaven to create disasters. His"
"energy to the first glance seemed so wonderfully like capacity! But he"
"had no imagination, no invention, only a stupid, vast, driving force of"
"will, and a mad faith in his stupid idiot ‘luck’ to pull him through. I"
"remember how we stood upon the headland watching the squadron circling"
"far away, and how I weighed the full meaning of the sight, seeing"
"clearly the way things must go. And then even it was not too late. I"
"might have gone back, I think, and saved the world. The people of the"
"north would follow me, I knew, granted only that in one thing I"
"respected their moral standards. The east and south would trust me as"
"they would trust no other northern man. And I knew I had only to put it"
"to her and she would have let me go . . . . Not because she did not"
"love me!"
"“Only I did not want to go; my will was all the other way about. I had"
"so newly thrown off the incubus of responsibility: I was still so fresh"
"a renegade from duty that the daylight clearness of what I ought to do"
"had no power at all to touch my will. My will was to live, to gather"
"pleasures and make my dear lady happy. But though this sense of vast"
"neglected duties had no power to draw me, it could make me silent and"
"preoccupied, it robbed the days I had spent of half their brightness"
"and roused me into dark meditations in the silence of the night. And as"
"I stood and watched Evesham’s aeroplanes sweep to and fro—those birds"
"of infinite ill omen—she stood beside me watching me, perceiving the"
"trouble indeed, but not perceiving it clearly—her eyes questioning my"
"face, her expression shaded with perplexity. Her face was gray because"
"the sunset was fading out of the sky. It was no fault of hers that she"
"held me. She had asked me to go from her, and again in the night time"
"and with tears she had asked me to go."
"“At last it was the sense of her that roused me from my mood. I turned"
"upon her suddenly and challenged her to race down the mountain slopes."
"‘No,’ she said, as if I had jarred with her gravity, but I was resolved"
"to end that gravity, and make her run—no one can be very gray and sad"
"who is out of breath—and when she stumbled I ran with my hand beneath"
"her arm. We ran down past a couple of men, who turned back staring in"
"astonishment at my behaviour—they must have recognised my face. And"
"half way down the slope came a tumult in the air, clang-clank,"
"clang-clank, and we stopped, and presently over the hill-crest those"
"war things came flying one behind the other.”"
"The man seemed hesitating on the verge of a description."
"“What were they like?” I asked."
"“They had never fought,” he said. “They were just like our ironclads"
"are nowadays; they had never fought. No one knew what they might do,"
"with excited men inside them; few even cared to speculate. They were"
"great driving things shaped like spear-heads without a shaft, with a"
"propeller in the place of the shaft.”"
"“Steel?”"
"“Not steel.”"
"“Aluminum?”"
"“No, no, nothing of that sort. An alloy that was very common—as common"
"as brass, for example. It was called—let me see—” He squeezed his"
"forehead with the fingers of one hand. “I am forgetting everything,” he"
"said."
"“And they carried guns?”"
"“Little guns, firing high explosive shells. They fired the guns"
"backwards, out of the base of the leaf, so to speak, and rammed with"
"the beak. That was the theory, you know, but they had never been"
"fought. No one could tell exactly what was going to happen. And"
"meanwhile I suppose it was very fine to go whirling through the air"
"like a flight of young swallows, swift and easy. I guess the captains"
"tried not to think too clearly what the real thing would be like. And"
"these flying war machines, you know, were only one sort of the endless"
"war contrivances that had been invented and had fallen into abeyance"
"during the long peace. There were all sorts of these things that people"
"were routing out and furbishing up; infernal things, silly things;"
"things that had never been tried; big engines, terrible explosives,"
"great guns. You know the silly way of these ingenious sort of men who"
"make these things; they turn ‘em out as beavers build dams, and with no"
"more sense of the rivers they’re going to divert and the lands they’re"
"going to flood!"
"“As we went down the winding stepway to our hotel again, in the"
"twilight, I foresaw it all: I saw how clearly and inevitably things"
"were driving for war in Evesham’s silly, violent hands, and I had some"
"inkling of what war was bound to be under these new conditions. And"
"even then, though I knew it was drawing near the limit of my"
"opportunity, I could find no will to go back.”"
"He sighed."
"“That was my last chance."
"“We didn’t go into the city until the sky was full of stars, so we"
"walked out upon the high terrace, to and fro, and—she counselled me to"
"go back."
"“‘My dearest,’ she said, and her sweet face looked up to me, this is"
"Death. This life you lead is Death. Go back to them, go back to your"
"duty—’"
"“She began to weep, saying, between her sobs, and clinging to my arm as"
"she said it, ‘Go back—Go back.’"
"“Then suddenly she fell mute, and, glancing down at her face, I read in"
"an instant the thing she had thought to do. It was one of those moments"
"when one sees."
"“‘No!’ I said."
"“‘No?’ she asked, in surprise and I think a little fearful at the"
"answer to her thought."
"“‘Nothing,’ I said, ‘shall send me back. Nothing! I have chosen. Love,"
"I have chosen, and the world must go. Whatever happens I will live this"
"life—I will live for you! It—nothing shall turn me aside; nothing, my"
"dear one. Even if you died—even if you died—’"
"“‘Yes?’ she murmured, softly."
"“‘Then—I also would die.’"
"“And before she could speak again I began to talk, talking"
"eloquently—as I could do in that life—talking to exalt love, to make"
"the life we were living seem heroic and glorious; and the thing I was"
"deserting something hard and enormously ignoble that it was a fine"
"thing to set aside. I bent all my mind to throw that glamour upon it,"
"seeking not only to convert her but myself to that. We talked, and she"
"clung to me, torn too between all that she deemed noble and all that"
"she knew was sweet. And at last I did make it heroic, made all the"
"thickening disaster of the world only a sort of glorious setting to our"
"unparalleled love, and we two poor foolish souls strutted there at"
"last, clad in that splendid delusion, drunken rather with that glorious"
"delusion, under the still stars."
"“And so my moment passed."
"“It was my last chance. Even as we went to and fro there, the leaders"
"of the south and east were gathering their resolve, and the hot answer"
"that shattered Evesham’s bluffing for ever, took shape and waited. And,"
"all over Asia, and the ocean, and the South, the air and the wires were"
"throbbing with their warnings to prepare—prepare."
"“No one living, you know, knew what war was; no one could imagine, with"
"all these new inventions, what horror war might bring. I believe most"
"people still believed it would be a matter of bright uniforms and"
"shouting charges and triumphs and flags and bands—in a time when half"
"the world drew its food supply from regions ten thousand miles away—”"
"The man with the white face paused. I glanced at him, and his face was"
"intent on the floor of the carriage. A little railway station, a string"
"of loaded trucks, a signal-box, and the back of a cottage, shot by the"
"carriage window, and a bridge passed with a clap of noise, echoing the"
"tumult of the train."
"“After that,” he said, “I dreamt often. For three weeks of nights that"
"dream was my life. And the worst of it was there were nights when I"
"could not dream, when I lay tossing on a bed in this accursed life; and"
"there—somewhere lost to me—things were happening—momentous, terrible"
"things . . . I lived at nights—my days, my waking days, this life I am"
"living now, became a faded, far-away dream, a drab setting, the cover"
"of the book.”"
"He thought."
"“I could tell you all, tell you every little thing in the dream, but as"
"to what I did in the daytime—no. I could not tell—I do not remember. My"
"memory—my memory has gone. The business of life slips from me—”"
"He leant forward, and pressed his hands upon his eyes. For a long time"
"he said nothing."
"“And then?” said I."
"“The war burst like a hurricane.”"
"He stared before him at unspeakable things."
"“And then?” I urged again."
"“One touch of unreality,” he said, in the low tone of a man who speaks"
"to himself, “and they would have been nightmares. But they were not"
"nightmares—they were not nightmares. No!”"
"He was silent for so long that it dawned upon me that there was a"
"danger of losing the rest of the story. But he went on talking again in"
"the same tone of questioning self-communion."
"“What was there to do but flight? I had not thought the war would touch"
"Capri—I had seemed to see Capri as being out of it all, as the contrast"
"to it all; but two nights after the whole place was shouting and"
"bawling, every woman almost and every other man wore a badge—Evesham’s"
"badge—and there was no music but a jangling war-song over and over"
"again, and everywhere men enlisting, and in the dancing halls they were"
"drilling. The whole island was awhirl with rumours; it was said, again"
"and again, that fighting had begun. I had not expected this. I had seen"
"so little of the life of pleasure that I had failed to reckon with this"
"violence of the amateurs. And as for me, I was out of it. I was like"
"the man who might have prevented the firing of a magazine. The time had"
"gone. I was no one; the vainest stripling with a badge counted for more"
"than I. The crowd jostled us and bawled in our ears; that accursed song"
"deafened us; a woman shrieked at my lady because no badge was on her,"
"and we two went back to our own place again, ruffled and insulted—my"
"lady white and silent, and I aquiver with rage. So furious was I, I"
"could have quarrelled with her if I could have found one shade of"
"accusation in her eyes."
"“All my magnificence had gone from me. I walked up and down our rock"
"cell, and outside was the darkling sea and a light to the southward"
"that flared and passed and came again."
"“‘We must get out of this place,’ I said over and over. ‘I have made my"
"choice, and I will have no hand in these troubles. I will have nothing"
"of this war. We have taken our lives out of all these things. This is"
"no refuge for us. Let us go.’"
"“And the next day we were already in flight from the war that covered"
"the world."
"“And all the rest was Flight—all the rest was Flight.”"
"He mused darkly."
"“How much was there of it?”"
"He made no answer."
"“How many days?”"
"His face was white and drawn and his hands were clenched. He took no"
"heed of my curiosity."
"I tried to draw him back to his story with questions."
"“Where did you go?” I said."
"“When?”"
"“When you left Capri.”"
"“South-west,” he said, and glanced at me for a second. “We went in a"
"boat.”"
"“But I should have thought an aeroplane?”"
"“They had been seized.”"
"I questioned him no more. Presently I thought he was beginning again."
"He broke out in an argumentative monotone:"
"“But why should it be? If, indeed, this battle, this slaughter and"
"stress is life, why have we this craving for pleasure and beauty? If"
"there is no refuge, if there is no place of peace, and if all our"
"dreams of quiet places are a folly and a snare, why have we such"
"dreams? Surely it was no ignoble cravings, no base intentions, had"
"brought us to this; it was Love had isolated us. Love had come to me"
"with her eyes and robed in her beauty, more glorious than all else in"
"life, in the very shape and colour of life, and summoned me away. I had"
"silenced all the voices, I had answered all the questions—I had come to"
"her. And suddenly there was nothing but War and Death!”"
"I had an inspiration. “After all,” I said, “it could have been only a"
"dream.”"
"“A dream!” he cried, flaming upon me, “a dream—when, even now—”"
"For the first time he became animated. A faint flush crept into his"
"cheek. He raised his open hand and clenched it, and dropped it to his"
"knee. He spoke, looking away from me, and for all the rest of the time"
"he looked away. “We are but phantoms!” he said, “and the phantoms of"
"phantoms, desires like cloud-shadows and wills of straw that eddy in"
"the wind; the days pass, use and wont carry us through as a train"
"carries the shadow of its lights—so be it! But one thing is real and"
"certain, one thing is no dream-stuff, but eternal and enduring. It is"
"the centre of my life, and all other things about it are subordinate or"
"altogether vain. I loved her, that woman of a dream. And she and I are"
"dead together!"
"“A dream! How can it be a dream, when it drenched a living life with"
"unappeasable sorrow, when it makes all that I have lived for and cared"
"for, worthless and unmeaning?"
"“Until that very moment when she was killed I believed we had still a"
"chance of getting away,” he said. “All through the night and morning"
"that we sailed across the sea from Capri to Salerno, we talked of"
"escape. We were full of hope, and it clung about us to the end, hope"
"for the life together we should lead, out of it all, out of the battle"
"and struggle, the wild and empty passions, the empty arbitrary ‘thou"
"shalt’ and ‘thou shalt not’ of the world. We were uplifted, as though"
"our quest was a holy thing, as though love for another was a mission ."
". . ."
"“Even when from our boat we saw the fair face of that great rock"
"Capri—already scarred and gashed by the gun emplacements and"
"hiding-places that were to make it a fastness—we reckoned nothing of"
"the imminent slaughter, though the fury of preparation hung about in"
"the puffs and clouds of dust at a hundred points amidst the gray; but,"
"indeed, I made a text of that and talked. There, you know, was the"
"rock, still beautiful for all its scars, with its countless windows and"
"arches and ways, tier upon tier, for a thousand feet, a vast carving of"
"gray, broken by vine-clad terraces, and lemon and orange groves, and"
"masses of agave and prickly pear, and puffs of almond blossom. And out"
"under the archway that is built over the Piccola Marina other boats"
"were coming; and as we came round the cape and within sight of the"
"mainland, another little string of boats came into view, driving before"
"the wind towards the south-west. In a little while a multitude had come"
"out, the remoter just little specks of ultramarine in the shadow of the"
"eastward cliff."
"“‘It is love and reason,’ I said, ‘fleeing from all this madness of"
"war.’"
"“And though we presently saw a squadron of aeroplanes flying across the"
"southern sky we did not heed it. There it was—a line of little dots in"
"the sky—and then more, dotting the south-eastern horizon, and then"
"still more, until all that quarter of the sky was stippled with blue"
"specks. Now they were all thin little strokes of blue, and now one and"
"now a multitude would heel and catch the sun and become short flashes"
"of light. They came, rising and falling and growing larger, like some"
"huge flight of gulls or rooks or such-like birds, moving with a"
"marvellous uniformity, and ever as they drew nearer they spread over a"
"greater width of sky. The southward wind flung itself in an"
"arrow-headed cloud athwart the sun. And then suddenly they swept round"
"to the eastward and streamed eastward, growing smaller and smaller and"
"clearer and clearer again until they vanished from the sky. And after"
"that we noted to the northward and very high Evesham’s fighting"
"machines hanging high over Naples like an evening swarm of gnats."
"“It seemed to have no more to do with us than a flight of birds."
"“Even the mutter of guns far away in the south-east seemed to us to"
"signify nothing . . ."
"“Each day, each dream after that, we were still exalted, still seeking"
"that refuge where we might live and love. Fatigue had come upon us,"
"pain and many distresses. For though we were dusty and stained by our"
"toilsome tramping, and half starved and with the horror of the dead men"
"we had seen and the flight of the peasants—for very soon a gust of"
"fighting swept up the peninsula—with these things haunting our minds it"
"still resulted only in a deepening resolution to escape. Oh, but she"
"was brave and patient! She who had never faced hardship and exposure"
"had courage for herself and me. We went to and fro seeking an outlet,"
"over a country all commandeered and ransacked by the gathering hosts of"
"war. Always we went on foot. At first there were other fugitives, but"
"we did not mingle with them. Some escaped northward, some were caught"
"in the torrent of peasantry that swept along the main roads; many gave"
"themselves into the hands of the soldiery and were sent northward. Many"
"of the men were impressed. But we kept away from these things; we had"
"brought no money to bribe a passage north, and I feared for my lady at"
"the hands of these conscript crowds. We had landed at Salerno, and we"
"had been turned back from Cava, and we had tried to cross towards"
"Taranto by a pass over Mount Alburno, but we had been driven back for"
"want of food, and so we had come down among the marshes by Paestum,"
"where those great temples stand alone. I had some vague idea that by"
"Paestum it might be possible to find a boat or something, and take once"
"more to sea. And there it was the battle overtook us."
"“A sort of soul-blindness had me. Plainly I could see that we were"
"being hemmed in; that the great net of that giant Warfare had us in its"
"toils. Many times we had seen the levies that had come down from the"
"north going to and fro, and had come upon them in the distance amidst"
"the mountains making ways for the ammunition and preparing the mounting"
"of the guns. Once we fancied they had fired at us, taking us for"
"spies—at any rate a shot had gone shuddering over us. Several times we"
"had hidden in woods from hovering aeroplanes."
"“But all these things do not matter now, these nights of flight and"
"pain . . . We were in an open place near those great temples at"
"Paestum, at last, on a blank stony place dotted with spiky bushes,"
"empty and desolate and so flat that a grove of eucalyptus far away"
"showed to the feet of its stems. How I can see it! My lady was sitting"
"down under a bush resting a little, for she was very weak and weary,"
"and I was standing up watching to see if I could tell the distance of"
"the firing that came and went. They were still, you know, fighting far"
"from each other, with those terrible new weapons that had never before"
"been used: guns that would carry beyond sight, and aeroplanes that"
"would do—What they would do no man could foretell."
"“I knew that we were between the two armies, and that they drew"
"together. I knew we were in danger, and that we could not stop there"
"and rest!"
"“Though all these things were in my mind, they were in the background."
"They seemed to be affairs beyond our concern. Chiefly, I was thinking"
"of my lady. An aching distress filled me. For the first time she had"
"owned herself beaten and had fallen a-weeping. Behind me I could hear"
"her sobbing, but I would not turn round to her because I knew she had"
"need of weeping, and had held herself so far and so long for me. It was"
"well, I thought, that she would weep and rest and then we would toil on"
"again, for I had no inkling of the thing that hung so near. Even now I"
"can see her as she sat there, her lovely hair upon her shoulder, can"
"mark again the deepening hollow of her cheek."
"“‘If we had parted,’ she said, ‘if I had let you go.’"
"“‘No,’ said I. ‘Even now, I do not repent. I will not repent; I made my"
"choice, and I will hold on to the end.’"
"“And then—"
"“Overhead in the sky flashed something and burst, and all about us I"
"heard the bullets making a noise like a handful of peas suddenly"
"thrown. They chipped the stones about us, and whirled fragments from"
"the bricks and passed . . . .”"
"He put his hand to his mouth, and then moistened his lips."
"“At the flash I had turned about . . ."
"“You know—she stood up—"
"“She stood up, you know, and moved a step towards me—as though she"
"wanted to reach me—"
"“And she had been shot through the heart.”"
"He stopped and stared at me. I felt all that foolish incapacity an"
"Englishman feels on such occasions. I met his eyes for a moment, and"
"then stared out of the window. For a long space we kept silence. When"
"at last I looked at him he was sitting back in his corner, his arms"
"folded, and his teeth gnawing at his knuckles."
"He bit his nail suddenly, and stared at it."
"“I carried her,” he said, “towards the temples, in my arms—as though it"
"mattered. I don’t know why. They seemed a sort of sanctuary, you know,"
"they had lasted so long, I suppose."
"“She must have died almost instantly. Only—I talked to her all the"
"way.”"
"Silence again."
"“I have seen those temples,” I said abruptly, and indeed he had brought"
"those still, sunlit arcades of worn sandstone very vividly before me."
"“It was the brown one, the big brown one. I sat down on a fallen pillar"
"and held her in my arms . . . Silent after the first babble was over."
"And after a little while the lizards came out and ran about again, as"
"though nothing unusual was going on, as though nothing had changed . ."
". It was tremendously still there, the sun high and the shadows still;"
"even the shadows of the weeds upon the entablature were still—in spite"
"of the thudding and banging that went all about the sky."
"“I seem to remember that the aeroplanes came up out of the south, and"
"that the battle went away to the west. One aeroplane was struck, and"
"overset and fell. I remember that—though it didn’t interest me in the"
"least. It didn’t seem to signify. It was like a wounded gull, you"
"know—flapping for a time in the water. I could see it down the aisle of"
"the temple—a black thing in the bright blue water."
"“Three or four times shells burst about the beach, and then that"
"ceased. Each time that happened all the lizards scuttled in and hid for"
"a space. That was all the mischief done, except that once a stray"
"bullet gashed the stone hard by—made just a fresh bright surface."
"“As the shadows grew longer, the stillness seemed greater."
"“The curious thing,” he remarked, with the manner of a man who makes a"
"trivial conversation, “is that I didn’t _think_—at all. I sat with her"
"in my arms amidst the stones—in a sort of lethargy—stagnant."
"“And I don’t remember waking up. I don’t remember dressing that day. I"
"know I found myself in my office, with my letters all slit open in"
"front of me, and how I was struck by the absurdity of being there,"
"seeing that in reality I was sitting, stunned, in that Paestum Temple"
"with a dead woman in my arms. I read my letters like a machine. I have"
"forgotten what they were about.”"
"He stopped, and there was a long silence."
"Suddenly I perceived that we were running down the incline from Chalk"
"Farm to Euston. I started at this passing of time. I turned on him with"
"a brutal question, with the tone of “Now or never.”"
"“And did you dream again?”"
"“Yes.”"
"He seemed to force himself to finish. His voice was very low."
"“Once more, and as it were only for a few instants. I seemed to have"
"suddenly awakened out of a great apathy, to have risen into a sitting"
"position, and the body lay there on the stones beside me. A gaunt body."
"Not her, you know. So soon—it was not her . . . ."
"“I may have heard voices. I do not know. Only I knew clearly that men"
"were coming into the solitude and that that was a last outrage."
"“I stood up and walked through the temple, and then there came into"
"sight—first one man with a yellow face, dressed in a uniform of dirty"
"white, trimmed with blue, and then several, climbing to the crest of"
"the old wall of the vanished city, and crouching there. They were"
"little bright figures in the sunlight, and there they hung, weapon in"
"hand, peering cautiously before them."
"“And further away I saw others and then more at another point in the"
"wall. It was a long lax line of men in open order."
"“Presently the man I had first seen stood up and shouted a command, and"
"his men came tumbling down the wall and into the high weeds towards the"
"temple. He scrambled down with them and led them. He came facing"
"towards me, and when he saw me he stopped."
"“At first I had watched these men with a mere curiosity, but when I had"
"seen they meant to come to the temple I was moved to forbid them. I"
"shouted to the officer."
"“‘You must not come here,’ I cried, ‘_I_ am here. I am here with my"
"dead.’"
"“He stared, and then shouted a question back to me in some unknown"
"tongue."
"“I repeated what I had said."
"“He shouted again, and I folded my arms and stood still. Presently he"
"spoke to his men and came forward. He carried a drawn sword."
"“I signed to him to keep away, but he continued to advance. I told him"
"again very patiently and clearly: ‘You must not come here. These are"
"old temples and I am here with my dead.’"
"“Presently he was so close I could see his face clearly. It was a"
"narrow face, with dull gray eyes, and a black moustache. He had a scar"
"on his upper lip, and he was dirty and unshaven. He kept shouting"
"unintelligible things, questions, perhaps, at me."
"“I know now that he was afraid of me, but at the time that did not"
"occur to me. As I tried to explain to him, he interrupted me in"
"imperious tones, bidding me, I suppose, stand aside."
"“He made to go past me, and I caught hold of him."
"“I saw his face change at my grip."
"“‘You fool,’ I cried. ‘Don’t you know? She is dead!’"
"“He started back. He looked at me with cruel eyes. I saw a sort of"
"exultant resolve leap into them—delight. Then, suddenly, with a scowl,"
"he swept his sword back—_so_—and thrust.”"
"He stopped abruptly."
"I became aware of a change in the rhythm of the train. The brakes"
"lifted their voices and the carriage jarred and jerked. This present"
"world insisted upon itself, became clamourous. I saw through the steamy"
"window huge electric lights glaring down from tall masts upon a fog,"
"saw rows of stationary empty carriages passing by, and then a"
"signal-box hoisting its constellation of green and red into the murky"
"London twilight, marched after them. I looked again at his drawn"
"features."
"“He ran me through the heart. It was with a sort of astonishment—no"
"fear, no pain—but just amazement, that I felt it pierce me, felt the"
"sword drive home into my body. It didn’t hurt, you know. It didn’t hurt"
"at all.”"
"The yellow platform lights came into the field of view, passing first"
"rapidly, then slowly, and at last stopping with a jerk. Dim shapes of"
"men passed to and fro without."
"“Euston!” cried a voice."
"“Do you mean—?”"
"“There was no pain, no sting or smart. Amazement and then darkness"
"sweeping over everything. The hot, brutal face before me, the face of"
"the man who had killed me, seemed to recede. It swept out of"
"existence—”"
"“Euston!” clamoured the voices outside; “Euston!”"
"The carriage door opened admitting a flood of sound, and a porter stood"
"regarding us. The sounds of doors slamming, and the hoof-clatter of"
"cab-horses, and behind these things the featureless remote roar of the"
"London cobble-stones, came to my ears. A truckload of lighted lamps"
"blazed along the platform."
"“A darkness, a flood of darkness that opened and spread and blotted out"
"all things.”"
"“Any luggage, sir?” said the porter."
"“And that was the end?” I asked."
"He seemed to hesitate. Then, almost inaudibly, he answered, “_no_.”"
"“You mean?”"
"“I couldn’t get to her. She was there on the other side of the temple—"
"And then—”"
"“Yes,” I insisted. “Yes?”"
"“Nightmares,” he cried; “nightmares indeed! My God! Great birds that"
"fought and tore.”"
"THE CONE"
"The night was hot and overcast, the sky red, rimmed with the lingering"
"sunset of mid-summer. They sat at the open window, trying to fancy the"
"air was fresher there. The trees and shrubs of the garden stood stiff"
"and dark; beyond in the roadway a gas-lamp burnt, bright orange against"
"the hazy blue of the evening. Farther were the three lights of the"
"railway signal against the lowering sky. The man and woman spoke to one"
"another in low tones."
"“He does not suspect?” said the man, a little nervously."
"“Not he,” she said peevishly, as though that too irritated her. “He"
"thinks of nothing but the works and the prices of fuel. He has no"
"imagination, no poetry.”"
"“None of these men of iron have,” he said sententiously. “They have no"
"hearts.”"
"“_He_ has not,” she said. She turned her discontented face towards the"
"window. The distant sound of a roaring and rushing drew nearer and grew"
"in volume; the house quivered; one heard the metallic rattle of the"
"tender. As the train passed, there was a glare of light above the"
"cutting and a driving tumult of smoke; one, two, three, four, five,"
"six, seven, eight black oblongs—eight trucks—passed across the dim grey"
"of the embankment, and were suddenly extinguished one by one in the"
"throat of the tunnel, which, with the last, seemed to swallow down"
"train, smoke, and sound in one abrupt gulp."
"“This country was all fresh and beautiful once,” he said; “and now—it"
"is Gehenna. Down that way—nothing but pot-banks and chimneys belching"
"fire and dust into the face of heaven . . . . . But what does it"
"matter? An end comes, an end to all this cruelty . . . . ."
"_To-morrow_.” He spoke the last word in a whisper."
"“_To-morrow_,” she said, speaking in a whisper too, and still staring"
"out of the window."
"“Dear!” he said, putting his hand on hers."
"She turned with a start, and their eyes searched one another’s. Hers"
"softened to his gaze. “My dear one!” she said, and then: “It seems so"
"strange—that you should have come into my life like this—to open—” She"
"paused."
"“To open?” he said."
"“All this wonderful world—” she hesitated, and spoke still more"
"softly—“this world of _love_ to me.”"
"Then suddenly the door clicked and closed. They turned their heads, and"
"he started violently back. In the shadow of the room stood a great"
"shadowy figure—silent. They saw the face dimly in the half-light, with"
"unexpressive dark patches under the penthouse brows. Every muscle in"
"Raut’s body suddenly became tense. When could the door have opened?"
"What had he heard? Had he heard all? What had he seen? A tumult of"
"questions."
"The new-comer’s voice came at last, after a pause that seemed"
"interminable. “Well?” he said."
"“I was afraid I had missed you, Horrocks,” said the man at the window,"
"gripping the window-ledge with his hand. His voice was unsteady."
"The clumsy figure of Horrocks came forward out of the shadow. He made"
"no answer to Raut’s remark. For a moment he stood above them."
"The woman’s heart was cold within her. “I told Mr. Raut it was just"
"possible you might come back,” she said, in a voice that never"
"quivered."
"Horrocks, still silent, sat down abruptly in the chair by her little"
"work-table. His big hands were clenched; one saw now the fire of his"
"eyes under the shadow of his brows. He was trying to get his breath."
"His eyes went from the woman he had trusted to the friend he had"
"trusted, and then back to the woman."
"By this time and for the moment all three half understood one another."
"Yet none dared say a word to ease the pent-up things that choked them."
"It was the husband’s voice that broke the silence at last."
"“You wanted to see me?” he said to Raut."
"Raut started as he spoke. “I came to see you,” he said, resolved to lie"
"to the last."
"“Yes,” said Horrocks."
"“You promised,” said Raut, “to show me some fine effects of moonlight"
"and smoke.”"
"“I promised to show you some fine effects of moonlight and smoke,”"
"repeated Horrocks in a colourless voice."
"“And I thought I might catch you to-night before you went down to the"
"works,” proceeded Raut, “and come with you.”"
"There was another pause. Did the man mean to take the thing coolly? Did"
"he after all know? How long had he been in the room? Yet even at the"
"moment when they heard the door, their attitudes. . . . Horrocks"
"glanced at the profile of the woman, shadowy pallid in the half-light."
"Then he glanced at Raut, and seemed to recover himself suddenly. “Of"
"course,” he said, “I promised to show you the works under their proper"
"dramatic conditions. It’s odd how I could have forgotten.”"
"“If I am troubling you—” began Raut."
"Horrocks started again. A new light had suddenly come into the sultry"
"gloom of his eyes. “Not in the least,” he said."
"“Have you been telling Mr. Raut of all these contrasts of flame and"
"shadow you think so splendid?” said the woman, turning now to her"
"husband for the first time, her confidence creeping back again, her"
"voice just one half-note too high. “That dreadful theory of yours that"
"machinery is beautiful, and everything else in the world ugly. I"
"thought he would not spare you, Mr. Raut. It’s his great theory, his"
"one discovery in art.”"
"“I am slow to make discoveries,” said Horrocks grimly, damping her"
"suddenly. “But what I discover . . . . .” He stopped."
"“Well?” she said."
"“Nothing;” and suddenly he rose to his feet."
"“I promised to show you the works,” he said to Raut, and put his big,"
"clumsy hand on his friend’s shoulder. “And you are ready to go?”"
"“Quite,” said Raut, and stood up also."
"There was another pause. Each of them peered through the indistinctness"
"of the dusk at the other two. Horrocks’ hand still rested on Raut’s"
"shoulder. Raut half fancied still that the incident was trivial after"
"all. But Mrs. Horrocks knew her husband better, knew that grim quiet in"
"his voice, and the confusion in her mind took a vague shape of physical"
"evil. “Very well”, said Horrocks, and, dropping his hand, turned"
"towards the door."
"“My hat?” Raut looked round in the half-light."
"“That’s my work-basket,” said Mrs. Horrocks, with a gust of hysterical"
"laughter. Their hands came together on the back of the chair. “Here it"
"is!” he said. She had an impulse to warn him in an undertone, but she"
"could not frame a word. “Don’t go!” and “Beware of him!” struggled in"
"her mind, and the swift moment passed."
"“Got it?” said Horrocks, standing with the door half open."
"Raut stepped towards him. “Better say good-bye to Mrs. Horrocks,” said"
"the ironmaster, even more grimly quiet in his tone than before."
"Raut started and turned. “Good-evening, Mrs. Horrocks,” he said, and"
"their hands touched."
"Horrocks held the door open with a ceremonial politeness unusual in him"
"towards men. Raut went out, and then, after a wordless look at her, her"
"husband followed. She stood motionless while Raut’s light footfall and"
"her husband’s heavy tread, like bass and treble, passed down the"
"passage together. The front door slammed heavily. She went to the"
"window, moving slowly, and stood watching—leaning forward. The two men"
"appeared for a moment at the gateway in the road, passed under the"
"street lamp, and were hidden by the black masses of the shrubbery. The"
"lamp-light fell for a moment on their faces, showing only unmeaning"
"pale patches, telling nothing of what she still feared, and doubted,"
"and craved vainly to know. Then she sank down into a crouching attitude"
"in the big arm-chair, her eyes wide open and staring out at the red"
"lights from the furnaces that flickered in the sky. An hour after she"
"was still there, her attitude scarcely changed."
"The oppressive stillness of the evening weighed heavily upon Raut. They"
"went side by side down the road in silence, and in silence turned into"
"the cinder-made by-way that presently opened out the prospect of the"
"valley."
"A blue haze, half dust, half mist, touched the long valley with"
"mystery. Beyond were Hanley and Etruria, grey and dark masses, outlined"
"thinly by the rare golden dots of the street lamps, and here and there"
"a gaslit window, or the yellow glare of some late-working factory or"
"crowded public-house. Out of the masses, clear and slender against the"
"evening sky, rose a multitude of tall chimneys, many of them reeking, a"
"few smokeless during a season of “play.” Here and there a pallid patch"
"and ghostly stunted beehive shapes showed the position of a pot-bank,"
"or a wheel, black and sharp against the hot lower sky, marked some"
"colliery where they raise the iridescent coal of the place. Nearer at"
"hand was the broad stretch of railway, and half invisible trains"
"shunted—a steady puffing and rumbling, with every run a ringing"
"concussion and a rhythmic series of impacts, and a passage of"
"intermittent puffs of white steam across the further view. And to the"
"left, between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond,"
"dominating the whole view, colossal, inky-black, and crowned with smoke"
"and fitful flames, stood the great cylinders of the Jeddah Company"
"Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of the big ironworks of which"
"Horrocks was the manager. They stood heavy and threatening, full of an"
"incessant turmoil of flames and seething molten iron, and about the"
"feet of them rattled the rolling-mills, and the steam hammer beat"
"heavily and splashed the white iron sparks hither and thither. Even as"
"they looked, a truckful of fuel was shot into one of the giants, and"
"the red flames gleamed out, and a confusion of smoke and black dust"
"came boiling upwards towards the sky."
"“Certainly you get some fine effects of colour with your furnaces,”"
"said Raut, breaking a silence that had become apprehensive."
"Horrocks grunted. He stood with his hands in his pockets, frowning down"
"at the dim steaming railway and the busy ironworks beyond, frowning as"
"if he were thinking out some knotty problem."
"Raut glanced at him and away again. “At present your moonlight effect"
"is hardly ripe,” he continued, looking upward. “The moon is still"
"smothered by the vestiges of daylight.”"
"Horrocks stared at him with the expression of a man who has suddenly"
"awakened. “Vestiges of daylight? . . . . Of course, of course.” He too"
"looked up at the moon, pale still in the midsummer sky. “Come along,”"
"he said suddenly, and, gripping Raut’s arm in his hand, made a move"
"towards the path that dropped from them to the railway."
"Raut hung back. Their eyes met and saw a thousand things in a moment"
"that their eyes came near to say. Horrocks’ hand tightened and then"
"relaxed. He let go, and before Raut was aware of it, they were arm in"
"arm, and walking, one unwillingly enough, down the path."
"“You see the fine effect of the railway signals towards Burslem,” said"
"Horrocks, suddenly breaking into loquacity, striding fast, and"
"tightening the grip of his elbow the while. “Little green lights and"
"red and white lights, all against the haze. You have an eye for effect,"
"Raut. It’s a fine effect. And look at those furnaces of mine, how they"
"rise upon us as we come down the hill. That to the right is my"
"pet—seventy feet of him. I packed him myself, and he’s boiled away"
"cheerfully with iron in his guts for five long years. I’ve a particular"
"fancy for _him_. That line of red there—a lovely bit of warm orange"
"you’d call it, Raut—that’s the puddlers’ furnaces, and there, in the"
"hot light, three black figures—did you see the white splash of the"
"steam-hammer then?—that’s the rolling mills. Come along! Clang,"
"clatter, how it goes rattling across the floor! Sheet tin,"
"Raut,—amazing stuff. Glass mirrors are not in it when that stuff comes"
"from the mill. And, squelch!—there goes the hammer again. Come along!”"
"He had to stop talking to catch at his breath. His arm twisted into"
"Raut’s with benumbing tightness. He had come striding down the black"
"path towards the railway as though he was possessed. Raut had not"
"spoken a word, had simply hung back against Horrocks’ pull with all his"
"strength."
"“I say,” he said now, laughing nervously, but with an undernote of"
"snarl in his voice, “why on earth are you nipping my arm off, Horrocks,"
"and dragging me along like this?”"
"At length Horrocks released him. His manner changed again. “Nipping"
"your arm off?” he said. “Sorry. But it’s you taught me the trick of"
"walking in that friendly way.”"
"“You haven’t learnt the refinements of it yet then,” said Raut,"
"laughing artificially again. “By Jove! I’m black and blue.” Horrocks"
"offered no apology. They stood now near the bottom of the hill, close"
"to the fence that bordered the railway. The ironworks had grown larger"
"and spread out with their approach. They looked up to the blast"
"furnaces now instead of down; the further view of Etruria and Hanley"
"had dropped out of sight with their descent. Before them, by the stile"
"rose a notice-board, bearing still dimly visible, the words, “BEWARE OF"
"THE TRAINS,” half hidden by splashes of coaly mud."
"“Fine effects,” said Horrocks, waving his arm. “Here comes a train. The"
"puffs of smoke, the orange glare, the round eye of light in front of"
"it, the melodious rattle. Fine effects! But these furnaces of mine used"
"to be finer, before we shoved cones in their throats, and saved the"
"gas.”"
"“How?” said Raut. “Cones?”"
"“Cones, my man, cones. I’ll show you one nearer. The flames used to"
"flare out of the open throats, great—what is it?—pillars of cloud by"
"day, red and black smoke, and pillars of fire by night. Now we run it"
"off in pipes, and burn it to heat the blast, and the top is shut by a"
"cone. You’ll be interested in that cone.”"
"“But every now and then,” said Raut, “you get a burst of fire and smoke"
"up there.”"
"“The cone’s not fixed, it’s hung by a chain from a lever, and balanced"
"by an equipoise. You shall see it nearer. Else, of course, there’d be"
"no way of getting fuel into the thing. Every now and then the cone"
"dips, and out comes the flare.”"
"“I see,” said Raut. He looked over his shoulder. “The moon gets"
"brighter,” he said."
"“Come along,” said Horrocks abruptly, gripping his shoulder again, and"
"moving him suddenly towards the railway crossing. And then came one of"
"those swift incidents, vivid, but so rapid that they leave one doubtful"
"and reeling. Halfway across, Horrocks’ hand suddenly clenched upon him"
"like a vice, and swung him backward and through a half-turn, so that he"
"looked up the line. And there a chain of lamp-lit carriage-windows"
"telescoped swiftly as it came towards them, and the red and yellow"
"lights of an engine grew larger and larger, rushing down upon them. As"
"he grasped what this meant, he turned his face to Horrocks, and pushed"
"with all his strength against the arm that held him back between the"
"rails. The struggle did not last a moment. Just as certain as it was"
"that Horrocks held him there, so certain was it that he had been"
"violently lugged out of danger."
"“Out of the way,” said Horrocks, with a gasp, as the train came"
"rattling by, and they stood panting by the gate into the ironworks."
"“I did not see it coming,” said Raut, still, even in spite of his own"
"apprehensions, trying to keep up an appearance of ordinary intercourse."
"Horrocks answered with a grunt. “The cone,” he said, and then, as one"
"who recovers himself, “I thought you did not hear.”"
"“I didn’t,” said Raut."
"“I wouldn’t have had you run over then for the world,” said Horrocks."
"“For a moment I lost my nerve,” said Raut."
"Horrocks stood for half a minute, then turned abruptly towards the"
"ironworks again. “See how fine these great mounds of mine, these"
"clinker-heaps, look in the night! That truck yonder, up above there! Up"
"it goes, and out-tilts the slag. See the palpitating red stuff go"
"sliding down the slope. As we get nearer, the heap rises up and cuts"
"the blast furnaces. See the quiver up above the big one. Not that way!"
"This way, between the heaps. That goes to the puddling furnaces, but I"
"want to show you the canal first.” He came and took Raut by the elbow,"
"and so they went along side by side. Raut answered Horrocks vaguely."
"What, he asked himself, had really happened on the line? Was he"
"deluding himself with his own fancies, or had Horrocks actually held"
"him back in the way of the train? Had he just been within an ace of"
"being murdered?"
"Suppose this slouching, scowling monster _did_ know anything? For a"
"minute or two then Raut was really afraid for his life, but the mood"
"passed as he reasoned with himself. After all, Horrocks might have"
"heard nothing. At any rate, he had pulled him out of the way in time."
"His odd manner might be due to the mere vague jealousy he had shown"
"once before. He was talking now of the ash-heaps and the canal. “Eigh?”"
"said Horrocks."
"“What?” said Raut. “Rather! The haze in the moonlight. Fine!”"
"“Our canal,” said Horrocks, stopping suddenly. “Our canal by moonlight"
"and firelight is an immense effect. You’ve never seen it? Fancy that!"
"You’ve spent too many of your evenings philandering up in Newcastle"
"there. I tell you, for real florid effects—But you shall see. Boiling"
"water . . .”"
"As they came out of the labyrinth of clinker-heaps and mounds of coal"
"and ore, the noises of the rolling-mill sprang upon them suddenly,"
"loud, near, and distinct. Three shadowy workmen went by and touched"
"their caps to Horrocks. Their faces were vague in the darkness. Raut"
"felt a futile impulse to address them, and before he could frame his"
"words, they passed into the shadows. Horrocks pointed to the canal"
"close before them now: a weird-looking place it seemed, in the"
"blood-red reflections of the furnaces. The hot water that cooled the"
"tuyeres came into it, some fifty yards up—a tumultuous, almost boiling"
"affluent, and the steam rose up from the water in silent white wisps"
"and streaks, wrapping damply about them, an incessant succession of"
"ghosts coming up from the black and red eddies, a white uprising that"
"made the head swim. The shining black tower of the larger blast-furnace"
"rose overhead out of the mist, and its tumultuous riot filled their"
"ears. Raut kept away from the edge of the water, and watched Horrocks."
"“Here it is red,” said Horrocks, “blood-red vapour as red and hot as"
"sin; but yonder there, where the moonlight falls on it, and it drives"
"across the clinker-heaps, it is as white as death.”"
"Raut turned his head for a moment, and then came back hastily to his"
"watch on Horrocks. “Come along to the rolling-mills,” said Horrocks."
"The threatening hold was not so evident that time, and Raut felt a"
"little reassured. But all the same, what on earth did Horrocks mean"
"about “white as death” and “red as sin?” Coincidence, perhaps?"
"They went and stood behind the puddlers for a little while, and then"
"through the rolling-mills, where amidst an incessant din the deliberate"
"steam-hammer beat the juice out of the succulent iron, and black,"
"half-naked Titans rushed the plastic bars, like hot sealing-wax,"
"between the wheels. “Come on,” said Horrocks in Raut’s ear, and they"
"went and peeped through the little glass hole behind the tuyeres, and"
"saw the tumbled fire writhing in the pit of the blast-furnace. It left"
"one eye blinded for a while. Then, with green and blue patches dancing"
"across the dark, they went to the lift by which the trucks of ore and"
"fuel and lime were raised to the top of the big cylinder."
"And out upon the narrow rail that overhung the furnace, Raut’s doubts"
"came upon him again. Was it wise to be here? If Horrocks did"
"know—everything! Do what he would, he could not resist a violent"
"trembling. Right under foot was a sheer depth of seventy feet. It was a"
"dangerous place. They pushed by a truck of fuel to get to the railing"
"that crowned the place. The reek of the furnace, a sulphurous vapor"
"streaked with pungent bitterness, seemed to make the distant hillside"
"of Hanley quiver. The moon was riding out now from among a drift of"
"clouds, halfway up the sky above the undulating wooded outlines of"
"Newcastle. The steaming canal ran away from below them under an"
"indistinct bridge, and vanished into the dim haze of the flat fields"
"towards Burslem."
"“That’s the cone I’ve been telling you of,” shouted Horrocks; “and,"
"below that, sixty feet of fire and molten metal, with the air of the"
"blast frothing through it like gas in soda-water.”"
"Raut gripped the hand-rail tightly, and stared down at the cone. The"
"heat was intense. The boiling of the iron and the tumult of the blast"
"made a thunderous accompaniment to Horrocks’ voice. But the thing had"
"to be gone through now. Perhaps, after all . . ."
"“In the middle,” bawled Horrocks, “temperature near a thousand degrees."
"If _you_ were dropped into it . . . . flash into flame like a pinch of"
"gunpowder in a candle. Put your hand out and feel the heat of his"
"breath. Why, even up here I’ve seen the rain-water boiling off the"
"trucks. And that cone there. It’s a damned sight too hot for roasting"
"cakes. The top side of it’s three hundred degrees.”"
"“Three hundred degrees!” said Raut."
"“Three hundred centigrade, mind!” said Horrocks. “It will boil the"
"blood out of you in no time.”"
"“Eigh?” said Raut, and turned."
"“Boil the blood out of you in . . . No, you don’t!”"
"“Let me go!” screamed Raut. “Let go my arm!”"
"With one hand he clutched at the hand-rail, then with both. For a"
"moment the two men stood swaying. Then suddenly, with a violent jerk,"
"Horrocks had twisted him from his hold. He clutched at Horrocks and"
"missed, his foot went back into empty air; in mid-air he twisted"
"himself, and then cheek and shoulder and knee struck the hot cone"
"together."
"He clutched the chain by which the cone hung, and the thing sank an"
"infinitesimal amount as he struck it. A circle of glowing red appeared"
"about him, and a tongue of flame, released from the chaos within,"
"flickered up towards him. An intense pain assailed him at the knees,"
"and he could smell the singeing of his hands. He raised himself to his"
"feet, and tried to climb up the chain, and then something struck his"
"head. Black and shining with the moonlight, the throat of the furnace"
"rose about him."
"Horrocks, he saw, stood above him by one of the trucks of fuel on the"
"rail. The gesticulating figure was bright and white in the moonlight,"
"and shouting, “Fizzle, you fool! Fizzle, you hunter of women! You"
"hot-blooded hound! Boil! boil! boil!”"
"Suddenly he caught up a handful of coal out of the truck, and flung it"
"deliberately, lump after lump, at Raut."
"“Horrocks!” cried Raut. “Horrocks!”"
"He clung crying to the chain, pulling himself up from the burning of"
"the cone. Each missile Horrocks flung hit him. His clothes charred and"
"glowed, and as he struggled the cone dropped, and a rush of hot"
"suffocating gas whooped out and burned round him in a swift breath of"
"flame."
"His human likeness departed from him. When the momentary red had"
"passed, Horrocks saw a charred, blackened figure, its head streaked"
"with blood, still clutching and fumbling with the chain, and writhing"
"in agony—a cindery animal, an inhuman, monstrous creature that began a"
"sobbing intermittent shriek."
"Abruptly, at the sight, the ironmaster’s anger passed. A deadly"
"sickness came upon him. The heavy odour of burning flesh came drifting"
"up to his nostrils. His sanity returned to him."
"“God have mercy upon me!” he cried. “O God! what have I done?”"
"He knew the thing below him, save that it still moved and felt, was"
"already a dead man—that the blood of the poor wretch must be boiling in"
"his veins. An intense realisation of that agony came to his mind, and"
"overcame every other feeling. For a moment he stood irresolute, and"
"then, turning to the truck, he hastily tilted its contents upon the"
"struggling thing that had once been a man. The mass fell with a thud,"
"and went radiating over the cone. With the thud the shriek ended, and a"
"boiling confusion of smoke, dust, and flame came rushing up towards"
"him. As it passed, he saw the cone clear again."
"Then he staggered back, and stood trembling, clinging to the rail with"
"both hands. His lips moved, but no words came to them."
"Down below was the sound of voices and running steps. The clangour of"
"rolling in the shed ceased abruptly."
"A MOONLIGHT FABLE"
"There was once a little man whose mother made him a beautiful suit of"
"clothes. It was green and gold and woven so that I cannot describe how"
"delicate and fine it was, and there was a tie of orange fluffiness that"
"tied up under his chin. And the buttons in their newness shone like"
"stars. He was proud and pleased by his suit beyond measure, and stood"
"before the long looking-glass when first he put it on, so astonished"
"and delighted with it that he could hardly turn himself away."
"He wanted to wear it everywhere and show it to all sorts of people. He"
"thought over all the places he had ever visited and all the scenes he"
"had ever heard described, and tried to imagine what the feel of it"
"would be if he were to go now to those scenes and places wearing his"
"shining suit, and he wanted to go out forthwith into the long grass and"
"the hot sunshine of the meadow wearing it. Just to wear it! But his"
"mother told him, “No.” She told him he must take great care of his"
"suit, for never would he have another nearly so fine; he must save it"
"and save it and only wear it on rare and great occasions. It was his"
"wedding suit, she said. And she took his buttons and twisted them up"
"with tissue paper for fear their bright newness should be tarnished,"
"and she tacked little guards over the cuffs and elbows and wherever the"
"suit was most likely to come to harm. He hated and resisted these"
"things, but what could he do? And at last her warnings and persuasions"
"had effect and he consented to take off his beautiful suit and fold it"
"into its proper creases and put it away. It was almost as though he"
"gave it up again. But he was always thinking of wearing it and of the"
"supreme occasion when some day it might be worn without the guards,"
"without the tissue paper on the buttons, utterly and delightfully,"
"never caring, beautiful beyond measure."
"One night when he was dreaming of it, after his habit, he dreamed he"
"took the tissue paper from one of the buttons and found its brightness"
"a little faded, and that distressed him mightily in his dream. He"
"polished the poor faded button and polished it, and if anything it grew"
"duller. He woke up and lay awake thinking of the brightness a little"
"dulled and wondering how he would feel if perhaps when the great"
"occasion (whatever it might be) should arrive, one button should chance"
"to be ever so little short of its first glittering freshness, and for"
"days and days that thought remained with him, distressingly. And when"
"next his mother let him wear his suit, he was tempted and nearly gave"
"way to the temptation just to fumble off one little bit of tissue paper"
"and see if indeed the buttons were keeping as bright as ever."
"He went trimly along on his way to church full of this wild desire. For"
"you must know his mother did, with repeated and careful warnings, let"
"him wear his suit at times, on Sundays, for example, to and fro from"
"church, when there was no threatening of rain, no dust nor anything to"
"injure it, with its buttons covered and its protections tacked upon it"
"and a sunshade in his hand to shadow it if there seemed too strong a"
"sunlight for its colours. And always, after such occasions, he brushed"
"it over and folded it exquisitely as she had taught him, and put it"
"away again."
"Now all these restrictions his mother set to the wearing of his suit he"
"obeyed, always he obeyed them, until one strange night he woke up and"
"saw the moonlight shining outside his window. It seemed to him the"
"moonlight was not common moonlight, nor the night a common night, and"
"for a while he lay quite drowsily with this odd persuasion in his mind."
"Thought joined on to thought like things that whisper warmly in the"
"shadows. Then he sat up in his little bed suddenly, very alert, with"
"his heart beating very fast and a quiver in his body from top to toe."
"He had made up his mind. He knew now that he was going to wear his suit"
"as it should be worn. He had no doubt in the matter. He was afraid,"
"terribly afraid, but glad, glad."
"He got out of his bed and stood a moment by the window looking at the"
"moonshine-flooded garden and trembling at the thing he meant to do. The"
"air was full of a minute clamor of crickets and murmurings, of the"
"infinitesimal shouting of little living things. He went very gently"
"across the creaking boards, for fear that he might wake the sleeping"
"house, to the big dark clothes-press wherein his beautiful suit lay"
"folded, and he took it out garment by garment and softly and very"
"eagerly tore off its tissue-paper covering and its tacked protections,"
"until there it was, perfect and delightful as he had seen it when first"
"his mother had given it to him—a long time it seemed ago. Not a button"
"had tarnished, not a thread had faded on this dear suit of his; he was"
"glad enough for weeping as in a noiseless hurry he put it on. And then"
"back he went, soft and quick, to the window and looked out upon the"
"garden and stood there for a minute, shining in the moonlight, with his"
"buttons twinkling like stars, before he got out on the sill and, making"
"as little of a rustling as he could, clambered down to the garden path"
"below. He stood before his mother’s house, and it was white and nearly"
"as plain as by day, with every window-blind but his own shut like an"
"eye that sleeps. The trees cast still shadows like intricate black lace"
"upon the wall."
"The garden in the moonlight was very different from the garden by day;"
"moonshine was tangled in the hedges and stretched in phantom cobwebs"
"from spray to spray. Every flower was gleaming white or crimson black,"
"and the air was aquiver with the thridding of small crickets and"
"nightingales singing unseen in the depths of the trees."
"There was no darkness in the world, but only warm, mysterious shadows;"
"and all the leaves and spikes were edged and lined with iridescent"
"jewels of dew. The night was warmer than any night had ever been, the"
"heavens by some miracle at once vaster and nearer, and spite of the"
"great ivory-tinted moon that ruled the world, the sky was full of"
"stars."
"The little man did not shout nor sing for all his infinite gladness. He"
"stood for a time like one awe-stricken, and then, with a queer small"
"cry and holding out his arms, he ran out as if he would embrace at once"
"the whole warm round immensity of the world. He did not follow the neat"
"set paths that cut the garden squarely, but thrust across the beds and"
"through the wet, tall, scented herbs, through the night stock and the"
"nicotine and the clusters of phantom white mallow flowers and through"
"the thickets of southern-wood and lavender, and knee-deep across a wide"
"space of mignonette. He came to the great hedge and he thrust his way"
"through it, and though the thorns of the brambles scored him deeply and"
"tore threads from his wonderful suit, and though burs and goosegrass"
"and havers caught and clung to him, he did not care. He did not care,"
"for he knew it was all part of the wearing for which he had longed. “I"
"am glad I put on my suit,” he said; “I am glad I wore my suit.”"
"Beyond the hedge he came to the duck-pond, or at least to what was the"
"duck-pond by day. But by night it was a great bowl of silver moonshine"
"all noisy with singing frogs, of wonderful silver moonshine twisted and"
"clotted with strange patternings, and the little man ran down into its"
"waters between the thin black rushes, knee-deep and waist-deep and to"
"his shoulders, smiting the water to black and shining wavelets with"
"either hand, swaying and shivering wavelets, amid which the stars were"
"netted in the tangled reflections of the brooding trees upon the bank."
"He waded until he swam, and so he crossed the pond and came out upon"
"the other side, trailing, as it seemed to him, not duckweed, but very"
"silver in long, clinging, dripping masses. And up he went through the"
"transfigured tangles of the willow-herb and the uncut seeding grass of"
"the farther bank. And so he came glad and breathless into the highroad."
"“I am glad,” he said, “beyond measure, that I had clothes that fitted"
"this occasion.”"
"The highroad ran straight as an arrow flies, straight into the deep"
"blue pit of sky beneath the moon, a white and shining road between the"
"singing nightingales, and along it he went, running now and leaping,"
"and now walking and rejoicing, in the clothes his mother had made for"
"him with tireless, loving hands. The road was deep in dust, but that"
"for him was only soft whiteness, and as he went a great dim moth came"
"fluttering round his wet and shimmering and hastening figure. At first"
"he did not heed the moth, and then he waved his hands at it and made a"
"sort of dance with it as it circled round his head. “Soft moth!” he"
"cried, “dear moth! And wonderful night, wonderful night of the world!"
"Do you think my clothes are beautiful, dear moth? As beautiful as your"
"scales and all this silver vesture of the earth and sky?”"
"And the moth circled closer and closer until at last its velvet wings"
"just brushed his lips . . . . ."
"And next morning they found him dead with his neck broken in the bottom"
"of the stone pit, with his beautiful clothes a little bloody and foul"
"and stained with the duckweed from the pond. But his face was a face of"
"such happiness that, had you seen it, you would have understood indeed"
"how that he had died happy, never knowing the cool and streaming silver"
"for the duckweed in the pond."
"THE DIAMOND MAKER"
"Some business had detained me in Chancery Lane until nine in the"
"evening, and thereafter, having some inkling of a headache, I was"
"disinclined either for entertainment or further work. So much of the"
"sky as the high cliffs of that narrow canon of traffic left visible"
"spoke of a serene night, and I determined to make my way down to the"
"Embankment, and rest my eyes and cool my head by watching the"
"variegated lights upon the river. Beyond comparison the night is the"
"best time for this place; a merciful darkness hides the dirt of the"
"waters, and the lights of this transitional age, red glaring orange,"
"gas-yellow, and electric white, are set in shadowy outlines of every"
"possible shade between grey and deep purple. Through the arches of"
"Waterloo Bridge a hundred points of light mark the sweep of the"
"Embankment, and above its parapet rise the towers of Westminster, warm"
"grey against the starlight. The black river goes by with only a rare"
"ripple breaking its silence, and disturbing the reflections of the"
"lights that swim upon its surface."
"“A warm night,” said a voice at my side."
"I turned my head, and saw the profile of a man who was leaning over the"
"parapet beside me. It was a refined face, not unhandsome, though"
"pinched and pale enough, and the coat collar turned up and pinned round"
"the throat marked his status in life as sharply as a uniform. I felt I"
"was committed to the price of a bed and breakfast if I answered him."
"I looked at him curiously. Would he have anything to tell me worth the"
"money, or was he the common incapable—incapable even of telling his own"
"story? There was a quality of intelligence in his forehead and eyes,"
"and a certain tremulousness in his nether lip that decided me."
"“Very warm,” said I; “but not too warm for us here.”"
"“No,” he said, still looking across the water, “it is pleasant enough"
"here . . . . just now.”"
"“It is good,” he continued after a pause, “to find anything so restful"
"as this in London. After one has been fretting about business all day,"
"about getting on, meeting obligations, and parrying dangers, I do not"
"know what one would do if it were not for such pacific corners.” He"
"spoke with long pauses between the sentences. “You must know a little"
"of the irksome labour of the world, or you would not be here. But I"
"doubt if you can be so brain-weary and footsore as I am . . . . Bah!"
"Sometimes I doubt if the game is worth the candle. I feel inclined to"
"throw the whole thing over—name, wealth and position—and take to some"
"modest trade. But I know if I abandoned my ambition—hardly as she uses"
"me—I should have nothing but remorse left for the rest of my days.”"
"He became silent. I looked at him in astonishment. If ever I saw a man"
"hopelessly hard-up it was the man in front of me. He was ragged and he"
"was dirty, unshaven and unkempt; he looked as though he had been left"
"in a dust-bin for a week. And he was talking to _me_ of the irksome"
"worries of a large business. I almost laughed outright. Either he was"
"mad or playing a sorry jest on his own poverty."
"“If high aims and high positions,” said I, “have their drawbacks of"
"hard work and anxiety, they have their compensations. Influence, the"
"power of doing good, of assisting those weaker and poorer than"
"ourselves; and there is even a certain gratification in display . . . ."
". ”"
"My banter under the circumstances was in very vile taste. I spoke on"
"the spur of the contrast of his appearance and speech. I was sorry even"
"while I was speaking."
"He turned a haggard but very composed face upon me. Said he: “I forgot"
"myself. Of course you would not understand.”"
"He measured me for a moment. “No doubt it is very absurd. You will not"
"believe me even when I tell you, so that it is fairly safe to tell you."
"And it will be a comfort to tell someone. I really have a big business"
"in hand, a very big business. But there are troubles just now. The fact"
"is . . . . I make diamonds.”"
"“I suppose,” said I, “you are out of work just at present?”"
"“I am sick of being disbelieved,” he said impatiently, and suddenly"
"unbuttoning his wretched coat he pulled out a little canvas bag that"
"was hanging by a cord round his neck. From this he produced a brown"
"pebble. “I wonder if you know enough to know what that is?” He handed"
"it to me."
"Now, a year or so ago, I had occupied my leisure in taking a London"
"science degree, so that I have a smattering of physics and mineralogy."
"The thing was not unlike an uncut diamond of the darker sort, though"
"far too large, being almost as big as the top of my thumb. I took it,"
"and saw it had the form of a regular octahedron, with the curved faces"
"peculiar to the most precious of minerals. I took out my penknife and"
"tried to scratch it—vainly. Leaning forward towards the gas-lamp, I"
"tried the thing on my watch-glass, and scored a white line across that"
"with the greatest ease."
"I looked at my interlocutor with rising curiosity. “It certainly is"
"rather like a diamond. But, if so, it is a Behemoth of diamonds. Where"
"did you get it?”"
"“I tell you I made it,” he said. “Give it back to me.”"
"He replaced it hastily and buttoned his jacket. “I will sell it you for"
"one hundred pounds,” he suddenly whispered eagerly. With that my"
"suspicions returned. The thing might, after all, be merely a lump of"
"that almost equally hard substance, corundum, with an accidental"
"resemblance in shape to the diamond. Or if it was a diamond, how came"
"he by it, and why should he offer it at a hundred pounds?"
"We looked into one another’s eyes. He seemed eager, but honestly eager."
"At that moment I believed it was a diamond he was trying to sell. Yet I"
"am a poor man, a hundred pounds would leave a visible gap in my"
"fortunes and no sane man would buy a diamond by gaslight from a ragged"
"tramp on his personal warranty only. Still, a diamond that size"
"conjured up a vision of many thousands of pounds. Then, thought I, such"
"a stone could scarcely exist without being mentioned in every book on"
"gems, and again I called to mind the stories of contraband and"
"light-fingered Kaffirs at the Cape. I put the question of purchase on"
"one side."
"“How did you get it?” said I."
"“I made it.”"
"I had heard something of Moissan, but I knew his artificial diamonds"
"were very small. I shook my head."
"“You seem to know something of this kind of thing. I will tell you a"
"little about myself. Perhaps then you may think better of the"
"purchase.” He turned round with his back to the river, and put his"
"hands in his pockets. He sighed. “I know you will not believe me.”"
"“Diamonds,” he began—and as he spoke his voice lost its faint flavour"
"of the tramp and assumed something of the easy tone of an educated"
"man—“are to be made by throwing carbon out of combination in a suitable"
"flux and under a suitable pressure; the carbon crystallises out, not as"
"black-lead or charcoal-powder, but as small diamonds. So much has been"
"known to chemists for years, but no one yet had hit upon exactly the"
"right flux in which to melt up the carbon, or exactly the right"
"pressure for the best results. Consequently the diamonds made by"
"chemists are small and dark, and worthless as jewels. Now I, you know,"
"have given up my life to this problem—given my life to it."
"“I began to work at the conditions of diamond making when I was"
"seventeen, and now I am thirty-two. It seemed to me that it might take"
"all the thought and energies of a man for ten years, or twenty years,"
"but, even if it did, the game was still worth the candle. Suppose one"
"to have at last just hit the right trick before the secret got out and"
"diamonds became as common as coal, one might realize millions."
"Millions!”"
"He paused and looked for my sympathy. His eyes shone hungrily. “To"
"think,” said he, “that I am on the verge of it all, and here!"
"“I had,” he proceeded, “about a thousand pounds when I was twenty-one,"
"and this, I thought, eked out by a little teaching, would keep my"
"researches going. A year or two was spent in study, at Berlin chiefly,"
"and then I continued on my own account. The trouble was the secrecy."
"You see, if once I had let out what I was doing, other men might have"
"been spurred on by my belief in the practicability of the idea; and I"
"do not pretend to be such a genius as to have been sure of coming in"
"first, in the case of a race for the discovery. And you see it was"
"important that if I really meant to make a pile, people should not know"
"it was an artificial process and capable of turning out diamonds by the"
"ton. So I had to work all alone. At first I had a little laboratory,"
"but as my resources began to run out I had to conduct my experiments in"
"a wretched unfurnished room in Kentish Town, where I slept at last on a"
"straw mattress on the floor among all my apparatus. The money simply"
"flowed away. I grudged myself everything except scientific appliances."
"I tried to keep things going by a little teaching, but I am not a very"
"good teacher, and I have no university degree, nor very much education"
"except in chemistry, and I found I had to give a lot of time and labour"
"for precious little money. But I got nearer and nearer the thing. Three"
"years ago I settled the problem of the composition of the flux, and got"
"near the pressure by putting this flux of mine and a certain carbon"
"composition into a closed-up gun-barrel, filling up with water, sealing"
"tightly, and heating.”"
"He paused."
"“Rather risky,” said I."
"“Yes. It burst, and smashed all my windows and a lot of my apparatus;"
"but I got a kind of diamond powder nevertheless. Following out the"
"problem of getting a big pressure upon the molten mixture from which"
"the things were to crystallise, I hit upon some researches of Daubree’s"
"at the Paris _Laboratorie des Poudres et Salpetres_. He exploded"
"dynamite in a tightly screwed steel cylinder, too strong to burst, and"
"I found he could crush rocks into a muck not unlike the South African"
"bed in which diamonds are found. It was a tremendous strain on my"
"resources, but I got a steel cylinder made for my purpose after his"
"pattern. I put in all my stuff and my explosives, built up a fire in my"
"furnace, put the whole concern in, and—went out for a walk.”"
"I could not help laughing at his matter-of-fact manner. “Did you not"
"think it would blow up the house? Were there other people in the"
"place?”"
"“It was in the interest of science,” he said, ultimately. “There was a"
"costermonger family on the floor below, a begging-letter writer in the"
"room behind mine, and two flower-women were upstairs. Perhaps it was a"
"bit thoughtless. But possibly some of them were out."
"“When I came back the thing was just where I left it, among the"
"white-hot coals. The explosive hadn’t burst the case. And then I had a"
"problem to face. You know time is an important element in"
"crystallisation. If you hurry the process the crystals are small—it is"
"only by prolonged standing that they grow to any size. I resolved to"
"let this apparatus cool for two years, letting the temperature go down"
"slowly during the time. And I was now quite out of money; and with a"
"big fire and the rent of my room, as well as my hunger to satisfy, I"
"had scarcely a penny in the world."
"“I can hardly tell you all the shifts I was put to while I was making"
"the diamonds. I have sold newspapers, held horses, opened cab-doors."
"For many weeks I addressed envelopes. I had a place as assistant to a"
"man who owned a barrow, and used to call down one side of the road"
"while he called down the other."
"“Once for a week I had absolutely nothing to do, and I begged. What a"
"week that was! One day the fire was going out and I had eaten nothing"
"all day, and a little chap taking his girl out, gave me sixpence—to"
"show off. Thank heaven for vanity! How the fish-shops smelt! But I went"
"and spent it all on coals, and had the furnace bright red again, and"
"then—Well, hunger makes a fool of a man."
"“At last, three weeks ago, I let the fire out. I took my cylinder and"
"unscrewed it while it was still so hot that it punished my hands, and I"
"scraped out the crumbling lava-like mass with a chisel, and hammered it"
"into a powder upon an iron plate. And I found three big diamonds and"
"five small ones. As I sat on the floor hammering, my door opened, and"
"my neighbour, the begging-letter writer came in. He was drunk—as he"
"usually is. ‘Nerchist,’ said he. ‘You’re drunk,’ said I. ‘’Structive"
"scoundrel,’ said he. ‘Go to your father,’ said I, meaning the Father of"
"Lies. ‘Never you mind,’ said he, and gave me a cunning wink, and"
"hiccuped, and leaning up against the door, with his other eye against"
"the door-post, began to babble of how he had been prying in my room,"
"and how he had gone to the police that morning, and how they had taken"
"down everything he had to say—‘’siffiwas a ge’m,’ said he. Then I"
"suddenly realised I was in a hole. Either I should have to tell these"
"police my little secret, and get the whole thing blown upon, or be"
"lagged as an Anarchist. So I went up to my neighbour and took him by"
"the collar, and rolled him about a bit, and then I gathered up my"
"diamonds and cleared out. The evening newspapers called my den the"
"Kentish Town Bomb Factory. And now I cannot part with the things for"
"love or money."
"“If I go in to respectable jewellers they ask me to wait, and go and"
"whisper to a clerk to fetch a policeman, and then I say I cannot wait."
"And I found out a receiver of stolen goods, and he simply stuck to the"
"one I gave him and told me to prosecute if I wanted it back. I am going"
"about now with several hundred thousand pounds-worth of diamonds round"
"my neck, and without either food or shelter. You are the first person I"
"have taken into my confidence. But I like your face and I am"
"hard-driven.”"
"He looked into my eyes."
"“It would be madness,” said I, “for me to buy a diamond under the"
"circumstances. Besides, I do not carry hundreds of pounds about in my"
"pocket. Yet I more than half believe your story. I will, if you like,"
"do this: come to my office to-morrow . . . .”"
"“You think I am a thief!” said he keenly. “You will tell the police. I"
"am not coming into a trap.”"
"“Somehow I am assured you are no thief. Here is my card. Take that,"
"anyhow. You need not come to any appointment. Come when you will.”"
"He took the card, and an earnest of my good-will."
"“Think better of it and come,” said I."
"He shook his head doubtfully. “I will pay back your half-crown with"
"interest some day—such interest as will amaze you,” said he. “Anyhow,"
"you will keep the secret? . . . . Don’t follow me.”"
"He crossed the road and went into the darkness towards the little steps"
"under the archway leading into Essex Street, and I let him go. And that"
"was the last I ever saw of him."
"Afterwards I had two letters from him asking me to send bank-notes—not"
"cheques—to certain addresses. I weighed the matter over and took what I"
"conceived to be the wisest course. Once he called upon me when I was"
"out. My urchin described him as a very thin, dirty, and ragged man,"
"with a dreadful cough. He left no message. That was the finish of him"
"so far as my story goes. I wonder sometimes what has become of him. Was"
"he an ingenious monomaniac, or a fraudulent dealer in pebbles, or has"
"he really made diamonds as he asserted? The latter is just sufficiently"
"credible to make me think at times that I have missed the most"
"brilliant opportunity of my life. He may of course be dead, and his"
"diamonds carelessly thrown aside—one, I repeat, was almost as big as my"
"thumb. Or he may be still wandering about trying to sell the things. It"
"is just possible he may yet emerge upon society, and, passing athwart"
"my heavens in the serene altitude sacred to the wealthy and the"
"well-advertised, reproach me silently for my want of enterprise. I"
"sometimes think I might at least have risked five pounds."
"THE LORD OF THE DYNAMOS"
"The chief attendant of the three dynamos that buzzed and rattled at"
"Camberwell, and kept the electric railway going, came out of Yorkshire,"
"and his name was James Holroyd. He was a practical electrician, but"
"fond of whisky, a heavy red-haired brute with irregular teeth. He"
"doubted the existence of the deity, but accepted Carnot’s cycle, and he"
"had read Shakespeare and found him weak in chemistry. His helper came"
"out of the mysterious East, and his name was Azuma-zi. But Holroyd"
"called him Pooh-bah. Holroyd liked a nigger because he would stand"
"kicking—a habit with Holroyd—and did not pry into the machinery and try"
"to learn the ways of it. Certain odd possibilities of the negro mind"
"brought into abrupt contact with the crown of our civilisation Holroyd"
"never fully realised, though just at the end he got some inkling of"
"them."
"To define Azuma-zi was beyond ethnology. He was, perhaps, more negroid"
"than anything else, though his hair was curly rather than frizzy, and"
"his nose had a bridge. Moreover, his skin was brown rather than black,"
"and the whites of his eyes were yellow. His broad cheekbones and narrow"
"chin gave his face something of the viperine V. His head, too, was"
"broad behind, and low and narrow at the forehead, as if his brain had"
"been twisted round in the reverse way to a European’s. He was short of"
"stature and still shorter of English. In conversation he made numerous"
"odd noises of no known marketable value, and his infrequent words were"
"carved and wrought into heraldic grotesqueness. Holroyd tried to"
"elucidate his religious beliefs, and—especially after whisky—lectured"
"to him against superstition and missionaries. Azuma-zi, however,"
"shirked the discussion of his gods, even though he was kicked for it."
"Azuma-zi had come, clad in white but insufficient raiment, out of the"
"stokehole of the _Lord Clive_, from the Straits Settlements, and"
"beyond, into London. He had heard even in his youth of the greatness"
"and riches of London, where all the women are white and fair, and even"
"the beggars in the streets are white, and he arrived, with newly earned"
"gold coins in his pocket, to worship at the shrine of civilisation. The"
"day of his landing was a dismal one; the sky was dun, and a"
"wind-worried drizzle filtered down to the greasy streets, but he"
"plunged boldly into the delights of Shadwell, and was presently cast"
"up, shattered in health, civilised in costume, penniless and, except in"
"matters of the direst necessity, practically a dumb animal, to toil for"
"James Holroyd and to be bullied by him in the dynamo shed at"
"Camberwell. And to James Holroyd bullying was a labour of love."
"There were three dynamos with their engines at Camberwell. The two that"
"had been there since the beginning were small machines; the larger one"
"was new. The smaller machines made a reasonable noise; their straps"
"hummed over the drums, every now and then the brushes buzzed and"
"fizzled, and the air churned steadily, whoo! whoo! whoo! between their"
"poles. One was loose in its foundations and kept the shed vibrating."
"But the big dynamo drowned these little noises altogether with the"
"sustained drone of its iron core, which somehow set part of the"
"ironwork humming. The place made the visitor’s head reel with the"
"throb, throb, throb of the engines, the rotation of the big wheels, the"
"spinning ball-valves, the occasional spittings of the steam, and over"
"all the deep, unceasing, surging note of the big dynamo. This last"
"noise was from an engineering point of view a defect, but Azuma-zi"
"accounted it unto the monster for mightiness and pride."
"If it were possible we would have the noises of that shed always about"
"the reader as he reads, we would tell all our story to such an"
"accompaniment. It was a steady stream of din, from which the ear picked"
"out first one thread and then another; there was the intermittent"
"snorting, panting, and seething of the steam engines, the suck and thud"
"of their pistons, the dull beat on the air as the spokes of the great"
"driving-wheels came round, a note the leather straps made as they ran"
"tighter and looser, and a fretful tumult from the dynamos; and over"
"all, sometimes inaudible, as the ear tired of it, and then creeping"
"back upon the senses again, was this trombone note of the big machine."
"The floor never felt steady and quiet beneath one’s feet, but quivered"
"and jarred. It was a confusing, unsteady place, and enough to send"
"anyone’s thoughts jerking into odd zigzags. And for three months, while"
"the big strike of the engineers was in progress, Holroyd, who was a"
"blackleg, and Azuma-zi, who was a mere black, were never out of the"
"stir and eddy of it, but slept and fed in the little wooden shanty"
"between the shed and the gates."
"Holroyd delivered a theological lecture on the text of his big machine"
"soon after Azuma-zi came. He had to shout to be heard in the din. “Look"
"at that,” said Holroyd; “where’s your ‘eathen idol to match ‘im?” And"
"Azuma-zi looked. For a moment Holroyd was inaudible, and then Azuma-zi"
"heard: “Kill a hundred men. Twelve per cent. on the ordinary shares,”"
"said Holroyd, “and that’s something like a Gord!”"
"Holroyd was proud of his big dynamo, and expatiated upon its size and"
"power to Azuma-zi until heaven knows what odd currents of thought that"
"and the incessant whirling and shindy set up within the curly black"
"cranium. He would explain in the most graphic manner the dozen or so"
"ways in which a man might be killed by it, and once he gave Azuma-zi a"
"shock as a sample of its quality. After that, in the breathing-times of"
"his labour—it was heavy labour, being not only his own, but most of"
"Holroyd’s—Azuma-zi would sit and watch the big machine. Now and then"
"the brushes would sparkle and spit blue flashes, at which Holroyd would"
"swear, but all the rest was as smooth and rhythmic as breathing. The"
"band ran shouting over the shaft, and ever behind one as one watched"
"was the complacent thud of the piston. So it lived all day in this big"
"airy shed, with him and Holroyd to wait upon it; not prisoned up and"
"slaving to drive a ship as the other engines he knew—mere captive"
"devils of the British Solomon—had been, but a machine enthroned. Those"
"two smaller dynamos, Azuma-zi by force of contrast despised; the large"
"one he privately christened the Lord of the Dynamos. They were fretful"
"and irregular, but the big dynamo was steady. How great it was! How"
"serene and easy in its working! Greater and calmer even than the"
"Buddhas he had seen at Rangoon, and yet not motionless, but living! The"
"great black coils spun, spun, spun, the rings ran round under the"
"brushes, and the deep note of its coil steadied the whole. It affected"
"Azuma-zi queerly."
"Azuma-zi was not fond of labour. He would sit about and watch the Lord"
"of the Dynamos while Holroyd went away to persuade the yard porter to"
"get whisky, although his proper place was not in the dynamo shed but"
"behind the engines, and, moreover, if Holroyd caught him skulking he"
"got hit for it with a rod of stout copper wire. He would go and stand"
"close to the colossus and look up at the great leather band running"
"overhead. There was a black patch on the band that came round, and it"
"pleased him somehow among all the clatter to watch this return again"
"and again. Odd thoughts spun with the whirl of it. Scientific people"
"tell us that savages give souls to rocks and trees—and a machine is a"
"thousand times more alive than a rock or a tree. And Azuma-zi was"
"practically a savage still; the veneer of civilisation lay no deeper"
"than his slop suit, his bruises, and the coal grime on his face and"
"hands. His father before him had worshipped a meteoric stone, kindred"
"blood it may be had splashed the broad wheels of Juggernaut."
"He took every opportunity Holroyd gave him of touching and handling the"
"great dynamo that was fascinating him. He polished and cleaned it until"
"the metal parts were blinding in the sun. He felt a mysterious sense of"
"service in doing this. He would go up to it and touch its spinning"
"coils gently. The gods he had worshipped were all far away. The people"
"in London hid their gods."
"At last his dim feelings grew more distinct, and took shape in thoughts"
"and at last in acts. When he came into the roaring shed one morning he"
"salaamed to the Lord of the Dynamos, and then when Holroyd was away, he"
"went and whispered to the thundering machine that he was its servant,"
"and prayed it to have pity on him and save him from Holroyd. As he did"
"so a rare gleam of light came in through the open archway of the"
"throbbing machine-shed, and the Lord of the Dynamos, as he whirled and"
"roared, was radiant with pale gold. Then Azuma-zi knew that his service"
"was acceptable to his Lord. After that he did not feel so lonely as he"
"had done, and he had indeed been very much alone in London. And even"
"when his work time was over, which was rare, he loitered about the"
"shed."
"Then, the next time Holroyd maltreated him, Azuma-zi went presently to"
"the Lord of the Dynamos and whispered, “Thou seest, O my Lord!” and the"
"angry whir of the machinery seemed to answer him. Thereafter it"
"appeared to him that whenever Holroyd came into the shed a different"
"note came into the sounds of the dynamo. “My Lord bides his time,” said"
"Azuma-zi to himself. “The iniquity of the fool is not yet ripe.” And he"
"waited and watched for the day of reckoning. One day there was evidence"
"of short circuiting, and Holroyd, making an unwary examination—it was"
"in the afternoon—got a rather severe shock. Azuma-zi from behind the"
"engine saw him jump off and curse at the peccant coil."
"“He is warned,” said Azuma-zi to himself. “Surely my Lord is very"
"patient.”"
"Holroyd had at first initiated his “nigger” into such elementary"
"conceptions of the dynamo’s working as would enable him to take"
"temporary charge of the shed in his absence. But when he noticed the"
"manner in which Azuma-zi hung about the monster he became suspicious."
"He dimly perceived his assistant was “up to something,” and connecting"
"him with the anointing of the coils with oil that had rotted the"
"varnish in one place, he issued an edict, shouted above the confusion"
"of the machinery, “Don’t ‘ee go nigh that big dynamo any more,"
"Pooh-bah, or a’ll take thy skin off!” Besides, if it pleased Azuma-zi"
"to be near the big machine, it was plain sense and decency to keep him"
"away from it."
"Azuma-zi obeyed at the time, but later he was caught bowing before the"
"Lord of the Dynamos. At which Holroyd twisted his arm and kicked him as"
"he turned to go away. As Azuma-zi presently stood behind the engine and"
"glared at the back of the hated Holroyd, the noises of the machinery"
"took a new rhythm, and sounded like four words in his native tongue."
"It is hard to say exactly what madness is. I fancy Azuma-zi was mad."
"The incessant din and whirl of the dynamo shed may have churned up his"
"little store of knowledge and his big store of superstitious fancy, at"
"last, into something akin to frenzy. At any rate, when the idea of"
"making Holroyd a sacrifice to the Dynamo Fetich was thus suggested to"
"him, it filled him with a strange tumult of exultant emotion."
"That night the two men and their black shadows were alone in the shed"
"together. The shed was lit with one big arc light that winked and"
"flickered purple. The shadows lay black behind the dynamos, the ball"
"governors of the engines whirled from light to darkness, and their"
"pistons beat loud and steady. The world outside seen through the open"
"end of the shed seemed incredibly dim and remote. It seemed absolutely"
"silent, too, since the riot of the machinery drowned every external"
"sound. Far away was the black fence of the yard with grey shadowy"
"houses behind, and above was the deep blue sky and the pale little"
"stars. Azuma-zi suddenly walked across the centre of the shed above"
"which the leather bands were running, and went into the shadow by the"
"big dynamo. Holroyd heard a click, and the spin of the armature"
"changed."
"“What are you dewin’ with that switch?” he bawled in surprise. “Han’t I"
"told you—”"
"Then he saw the set expression of Azuma-zi’s eyes as the Asiatic came"
"out of the shadow towards him."
"In another moment the two men were grappling fiercely in front of the"
"great dynamo."
"“You coffee-headed fool!” gasped Holroyd, with a brown hand at his"
"throat. “Keep off those contact rings.” In another moment he was"
"tripped and reeling back upon the Lord of the Dynamos. He instinctively"
"loosened his grip upon his antagonist to save himself from the machine."
"The messenger, sent in furious haste from the station to find out what"
"had happened in the dynamo shed, met Azuma-zi at the porter’s lodge by"
"the gate. Azuma-zi tried to explain something, but the messenger could"
"make nothing of the black’s incoherent English, and hurried on to the"
"shed. The machines were all noisily at work, and nothing seemed to be"
"disarranged. There was, however, a queer smell of singed hair. Then he"
"saw an odd-looking crumpled mass clinging to the front of the big"
"dynamo, and, approaching, recognised the distorted remains of Holroyd."
"The man stared and hesitated a moment. Then he saw the face, and shut"
"his eyes convulsively. He turned on his heel before he opened them, so"
"that he should not see Holroyd again, and went out of the shed to get"
"advice and help."
"When Azuma-zi saw Holroyd die in the grip of the Great Dynamo he had"
"been a little scared about the consequences of his act. Yet he felt"
"strangely elated, and knew that the favour of the Lord Dynamo was upon"
"him. His plan was already settled when he met the man coming from the"
"station, and the scientific manager who speedily arrived on the scene"
"jumped at the obvious conclusion of suicide. This expert scarcely"
"noticed Azuma-zi, except to ask a few questions. Did he see Holroyd"
"kill himself? Azuma-zi explained that he had been out of sight at the"
"engine furnace until he heard a difference in the noise from the"
"dynamo. It was not a difficult examination, being untinctured by"
"suspicion."
"The distorted remains of Holroyd, which the electrician removed from"
"the machine, were hastily covered by the porter with a coffee-stained"
"tablecloth. Somebody, by a happy inspiration, fetched a medical man."
"The expert was chiefly anxious to get the machine at work again, for"
"seven or eight trains had stopped midway in the stuffy tunnels of the"
"electric railway. Azuma-zi, answering or misunderstanding the questions"
"of the people who had by authority or impudence come into the shed, was"
"presently sent back to the stoke-hole by the scientific manager. Of"
"course a crowd collected outside the gates of the yard—a crowd, for no"
"known reason, always hovers for a day or two near the scene of a sudden"
"death in London; two or three reporters percolated somehow into the"
"engine-shed, and one even got to Azuma-zi; but the scientific expert"
"cleared them out again, being himself an amateur journalist."
"Presently the body was carried away, and public interest departed with"
"it. Azuma-zi remained very quietly at his furnace, seeing over and over"
"again in the coals a figure that wriggled violently and became still."
"An hour after the murder, to anyone coming into the shed it would have"
"looked exactly as if nothing had ever happened there. Peeping presently"
"from his engine-room the black saw the Lord Dynamo spin and whirl"
"beside his little brothers, and the driving wheels were beating round,"
"and the steam in the pistons went thud, thud, exactly as it had been"
"earlier in the evening. After all, from the mechanical point of view,"
"it had been a most insignificant incident—the mere temporary deflection"
"of a current. But now the slender form and slender shadow of the"
"scientific manager replaced the sturdy outline of Holroyd travelling up"
"and down the lane of light upon the vibrating floor under the straps"
"between the engines and the dynamos."
"“Have I not served my Lord?” said Azuma-zi inaudibly, from his shadow,"
"and the note of the great dynamo rang out full and clear. As he looked"
"at the big whirling mechanism the strange fascination of it that had"
"been a little in abeyance since Holroyd’s death, resumed its sway."
"Never had Azuma-zi seen a man killed so swiftly and pitilessly. The big"
"humming machine had slain its victim without wavering for a second from"
"its steady beating. It was indeed a mighty god."
"The unconscious scientific manager stood with his back to him,"
"scribbling on a piece of paper. His shadow lay at the foot of the"
"monster."
"“Was the Lord Dynamo still hungry? His servant was ready.”"
"Azuma-zi made a stealthy step forward; then stopped. The scientific"
"manager suddenly stopped writing, and walked down the shed to the"
"endmost of the dynamos, and began to examine the brushes."
"Azuma-zi hesitated, and then slipped across noiselessly into shadow by"
"the switch. There he waited. Presently the manager’s footsteps could be"
"heard returning. He stopped in his old position, unconscious of the"
"stoker crouching ten feet away from him. Then the big dynamo suddenly"
"fizzled, and in another moment Azuma-zi had sprung out of the darkness"
"upon him."
"First, the scientific manager was gripped round the body and swung"
"towards the big dynamo, then, kicking with his knee and forcing his"
"antagonist’s head down with his hands, he loosened the grip on his"
"waist and swung round away from the machine. Then the black grasped him"
"again, putting a curly head against his chest, and they swayed and"
"panted as it seemed for an age or so. Then the scientific manager was"
"impelled to catch a black ear in his teeth and bite furiously. The"
"black yelled hideously."
"They rolled over on the floor, and the black, who had apparently"
"slipped from the vice of the teeth or parted with some ear—the"
"scientific manager wondered which at the time—tried to throttle him."
"The scientific manager was making some ineffectual attempts to claw"
"something with his hands and to kick, when the welcome sound of quick"
"footsteps sounded on the floor. The next moment Azuma-zi had left him"
"and darted towards the big dynamo. There was a splutter amid the roar."
"The officer of the company who had entered, stood staring as Azuma-zi"
"caught the naked terminals in his hands, gave one horrible convulsion,"
"and then hung motionless from the machine, his face violently"
"distorted."
"“I’m jolly glad you came in when you did,” said the scientific manager,"
"still sitting on the floor."
"He looked at the still quivering figure."
"“It’s not a nice death to die, apparently—but it is quick.”"
"The official was still staring at the body. He was a man of slow"
"apprehension."
"There was a pause."
"The scientific manager got up on his feet rather awkwardly. He ran his"
"fingers along his collar thoughtfully, and moved his head to and fro"
"several times."
"“Poor Holroyd! I see now.” Then almost mechanically he went towards the"
"switch in the shadow and turned the current into the railway circuit"
"again. As he did so the singed body loosened its grip upon the machine"
"and fell forward on its face. The core of the dynamo roared out loud"
"and clear, and the armature beat the air."
"So ended prematurely the Worship of the Dynamo Deity, perhaps the most"
"short-lived of all religions. Yet withal it could at least boast a"
"Martyrdom and a Human Sacrifice."
"THE COUNTRY OF THE BLIND"
"Three hundred miles and more from Chimborazo, one hundred from the"
"snows of Cotopaxi, in the wildest wastes of Ecuador’s Andes, there lies"
"that mysterious mountain valley, cut off from all the world of men, the"
"Country of the Blind. Long years ago that valley lay so far open to the"
"world that men might come at last through frightful gorges and over an"
"icy pass into its equable meadows, and thither indeed men came, a"
"family or so of Peruvian half-breeds fleeing from the lust and tyranny"
"of an evil Spanish ruler. Then came the stupendous outbreak of"
"Mindobamba, when it was night in Quito for seventeen days, and the"
"water was boiling at Yaguachi and all the fish floating dying even as"
"far as Guayaquil; everywhere along the Pacific slopes there were"
"land-slips and swift thawings and sudden floods, and one whole side of"
"the old Arauca crest slipped and came down in thunder, and cut off the"
"Country of the Blind for ever from the exploring feet of men. But one"
"of these early settlers had chanced to be on the hither side of the"
"gorges when the world had so terribly shaken itself, and he perforce"
"had to forget his wife and his child and all the friends and"
"possessions he had left up there, and start life over again in the"
"lower world. He started it again but ill, blindness overtook him, and"
"he died of punishment in the mines; but the story he told begot a"
"legend that lingers along the length of the Cordilleras of the Andes to"
"this day."
"He told of his reason for venturing back from that fastness, into which"
"he had first been carried lashed to a llama, beside a vast bale of"
"gear, when he was a child. The valley, he said, had in it all that the"
"heart of man could desire—sweet water, pasture, an even climate, slopes"
"of rich brown soil with tangles of a shrub that bore an excellent"
"fruit, and on one side great hanging forests of pine that held the"
"avalanches high. Far overhead, on three sides, vast cliffs of"
"grey-green rock were capped by cliffs of ice; but the glacier stream"
"came not to them, but flowed away by the farther slopes, and only now"
"and then huge ice masses fell on the valley side. In this valley it"
"neither rained nor snowed, but the abundant springs gave a rich green"
"pasture, that irrigation would spread over all the valley space. The"
"settlers did well indeed there. Their beasts did well and multiplied,"
"and but one thing marred their happiness. Yet it was enough to mar it"
"greatly. A strange disease had come upon them and had made all the"
"children born to them there—and, indeed, several older children"
"also—blind. It was to seek some charm or antidote against this plague"
"of blindness that he had with fatigue and danger and difficulty"
"returned down the gorge. In those days, in such cases, men did not"
"think of germs and infections, but of sins, and it seemed to him that"
"the reason of this affliction must lie in the negligence of these"
"priestless immigrants to set up a shrine so soon as they entered the"
"valley. He wanted a shrine—a handsome, cheap, effectual shrine—to be"
"erected in the valley; he wanted relics and such-like potent things of"
"faith, blessed objects and mysterious medals and prayers. In his wallet"
"he had a bar of native silver for which he would not account; he"
"insisted there was none in the valley with something of the insistence"
"of an inexpert liar. They had all clubbed their money and ornaments"
"together, having little need for such treasure up there, he said, to"
"buy them holy help against their ill. I figure this dim-eyed young"
"mountaineer, sunburnt, gaunt, and anxious, hat brim clutched"
"feverishly, a man all unused to the ways of the lower world, telling"
"this story to some keen-eyed, attentive priest before the great"
"convulsion; I can picture him presently seeking to return with pious"
"and infallible remedies against that trouble, and the infinite dismay"
"with which he must have faced the tumbled vastness where the gorge had"
"once come out. But the rest of his story of mischances is lost to me,"
"save that I know of his evil death after several years. Poor stray from"
"that remoteness! The stream that had once made the gorge now bursts"
"from the mouth of a rocky cave, and the legend his poor, ill-told story"
"set going developed into the legend of a race of blind men somewhere"
"“over there” one may still hear to-day."
"And amidst the little population of that now isolated and forgotten"
"valley the disease ran its course. The old became groping, the young"
"saw but dimly, and the children that were born to them never saw at"
"all. But life was very easy in that snow-rimmed basin, lost to all the"
"world, with neither thorns nor briers, with no evil insects nor any"
"beasts save the gentle breed of llamas they had lugged and thrust and"
"followed up the beds of the shrunken rivers in the gorges up which they"
"had come. The seeing had become purblind so gradually that they"
"scarcely noticed their loss. They guided the sightless youngsters"
"hither and thither until they knew the whole valley marvellously, and"
"when at last sight died out among them the race lived on. They had even"
"time to adapt themselves to the blind control of fire, which they made"
"carefully in stoves of stone. They were a simple strain of people at"
"the first, unlettered, only slightly touched with the Spanish"
"civilisation, but with something of a tradition of the arts of old Peru"
"and of its lost philosophy. Generation followed generation. They forgot"
"many things; they devised many things. Their tradition of the greater"
"world they came from became mythical in colour and uncertain. In all"
"things save sight they were strong and able, and presently chance sent"
"one who had an original mind and who could talk and persuade among"
"them, and then afterwards another. These two passed, leaving their"
"effects, and the little community grew in numbers and in understanding,"
"and met and settled social and economic problems that arose. Generation"
"followed generation. Generation followed generation. There came a time"
"when a child was born who was fifteen generations from that ancestor"
"who went out of the valley with a bar of silver to seek God’s aid, and"
"who never returned. Thereabout it chanced that a man came into this"
"community from the outer world. And this is the story of that man."
"He was a mountaineer from the country near Quito, a man who had been"
"down to the sea and had seen the world, a reader of books in an"
"original way, an acute and enterprising man, and he was taken on by a"
"party of Englishmen who had come out to Ecuador to climb mountains, to"
"replace one of their three Swiss guides who had fallen ill. He climbed"
"here and he climbed there, and then came the attempt on Parascotopetl,"
"the Matterhorn of the Andes, in which he was lost to the outer world."
"The story of that accident has been written a dozen times. Pointer’s"
"narrative is the best. He tells how the little party worked their"
"difficult and almost vertical way up to the very foot of the last and"
"greatest precipice, and how they built a night shelter amidst the snow"
"upon a little shelf of rock, and, with a touch of real dramatic power,"
"how presently they found Nunez had gone from them. They shouted, and"
"there was no reply; shouted and whistled, and for the rest of that"
"night they slept no more."
"As the morning broke they saw the traces of his fall. It seems"
"impossible he could have uttered a sound. He had slipped eastward"
"towards the unknown side of the mountain; far below he had struck a"
"steep slope of snow, and ploughed his way down it in the midst of a"
"snow avalanche. His track went straight to the edge of a frightful"
"precipice, and beyond that everything was hidden. Far, far below, and"
"hazy with distance, they could see trees rising out of a narrow,"
"shut-in valley—the lost Country of the Blind. But they did not know it"
"was the lost Country of the Blind, nor distinguish it in any way from"
"any other narrow streak of upland valley. Unnerved by this disaster,"
"they abandoned their attempt in the afternoon, and Pointer was called"
"away to the war before he could make another attack. To this day"
"Parascotopetl lifts an unconquered crest, and Pointer’s shelter"
"crumbles unvisited amidst the snows."
"And the man who fell survived."
"At the end of the slope he fell a thousand feet, and came down in the"
"midst of a cloud of snow upon a snow-slope even steeper than the one"
"above. Down this he was whirled, stunned and insensible, but without a"
"bone broken in his body; and then at last came to gentler slopes, and"
"at last rolled out and lay still, buried amidst a softening heap of the"
"white masses that had accompanied and saved him. He came to himself"
"with a dim fancy that he was ill in bed; then realized his position"
"with a mountaineer’s intelligence and worked himself loose and, after a"
"rest or so, out until he saw the stars. He rested flat upon his chest"
"for a space, wondering where he was and what had happened to him. He"
"explored his limbs, and discovered that several of his buttons were"
"gone and his coat turned over his head. His knife had gone from his"
"pocket and his hat was lost, though he had tied it under his chin. He"
"recalled that he had been looking for loose stones to raise his piece"
"of the shelter wall. His ice-axe had disappeared."
"He decided he must have fallen, and looked up to see, exaggerated by"
"the ghastly light of the rising moon, the tremendous flight he had"
"taken. For a while he lay, gazing blankly at the vast, pale cliff"
"towering above, rising moment by moment out of a subsiding tide of"
"darkness. Its phantasmal, mysterious beauty held him for a space, and"
"then he was seized with a paroxysm of sobbing laughter . . . ."
"After a great interval of time he became aware that he was near the"
"lower edge of the snow. Below, down what was now a moon-lit and"
"practicable slope, he saw the dark and broken appearance of rock-strewn"
"turf. He struggled to his feet, aching in every joint and limb, got"
"down painfully from the heaped loose snow about him, went downward"
"until he was on the turf, and there dropped rather than lay beside a"
"boulder, drank deep from the flask in his inner pocket, and instantly"
"fell asleep . . . ."
"He was awakened by the singing of birds in the trees far below."
"He sat up and perceived he was on a little alp at the foot of a vast"
"precipice that sloped only a little in the gully down which he and his"
"snow had come. Over against him another wall of rock reared itself"
"against the sky. The gorge between these precipices ran east and west"
"and was full of the morning sunlight, which lit to the westward the"
"mass of fallen mountain that closed the descending gorge. Below him it"
"seemed there was a precipice equally steep, but behind the snow in the"
"gully he found a sort of chimney-cleft dripping with snow-water, down"
"which a desperate man might venture. He found it easier than it seemed,"
"and came at last to another desolate alp, and then after a rock climb"
"of no particular difficulty, to a steep slope of trees. He took his"
"bearings and turned his face up the gorge, for he saw it opened out"
"above upon green meadows, among which he now glimpsed quite distinctly"
"a cluster of stone huts of unfamiliar fashion. At times his progress"
"was like clambering along the face of a wall, and after a time the"
"rising sun ceased to strike along the gorge, the voices of the singing"
"birds died away, and the air grew cold and dark about him. But the"
"distant valley with its houses was all the brighter for that. He came"
"presently to talus, and among the rocks he noted—for he was an"
"observant man—an unfamiliar fern that seemed to clutch out of the"
"crevices with intense green hands. He picked a frond or so and gnawed"
"its stalk, and found it helpful."
"About midday he came at last out of the throat of the gorge into the"
"plain and the sunlight. He was stiff and weary; he sat down in the"
"shadow of a rock, filled up his flask with water from a spring and"
"drank it down, and remained for a time, resting before he went on to"
"the houses."
"They were very strange to his eyes, and indeed the whole aspect of that"
"valley became, as he regarded it, queerer and more unfamiliar. The"
"greater part of its surface was lush green meadow, starred with many"
"beautiful flowers, irrigated with extraordinary care, and bearing"
"evidence of systematic cropping piece by piece. High up and ringing the"
"valley about was a wall, and what appeared to be a circumferential"
"water channel, from which the little trickles of water that fed the"
"meadow plants came, and on the higher slopes above this flocks of"
"llamas cropped the scanty herbage. Sheds, apparently shelters or"
"feeding-places for the llamas, stood against the boundary wall here and"
"there. The irrigation streams ran together into a main channel down the"
"centre of the valley, and this was enclosed on either side by a wall"
"breast high. This gave a singularly urban quality to this secluded"
"place, a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact that a number of"
"paths paved with black and white stones, and each with a curious little"
"kerb at the side, ran hither and thither in an orderly manner. The"
"houses of the central village were quite unlike the casual and"
"higgledy-piggledy agglomeration of the mountain villages he knew; they"
"stood in a continuous row on either side of a central street of"
"astonishing cleanness, here and there their parti-coloured facade was"
"pierced by a door, and not a solitary window broke their even frontage."
"They were parti-coloured with extraordinary irregularity, smeared with"
"a sort of plaster that was sometimes grey, sometimes drab, sometimes"
"slate-coloured or dark brown; and it was the sight of this wild"
"plastering first brought the word “blind” into the thoughts of the"
"explorer. “The good man who did that,” he thought, “must have been as"
"blind as a bat.”"
"He descended a steep place, and so came to the wall and channel that"
"ran about the valley, near where the latter spouted out its surplus"
"contents into the deeps of the gorge in a thin and wavering thread of"
"cascade. He could now see a number of men and women resting on piled"
"heaps of grass, as if taking a siesta, in the remoter part of the"
"meadow, and nearer the village a number of recumbent children, and then"
"nearer at hand three men carrying pails on yokes along a little path"
"that ran from the encircling wall towards the houses. These latter were"
"clad in garments of llama cloth and boots and belts of leather, and"
"they wore caps of cloth with back and ear flaps. They followed one"
"another in single file, walking slowly and yawning as they walked, like"
"men who have been up all night. There was something so reassuringly"
"prosperous and respectable in their bearing that after a moment’s"
"hesitation Nunez stood forward as conspicuously as possible upon his"
"rock, and gave vent to a mighty shout that echoed round the valley."
"The three men stopped, and moved their heads as though they were"
"looking about them. They turned their faces this way and that, and"
"Nunez gesticulated with freedom. But they did not appear to see him for"
"all his gestures, and after a time, directing themselves towards the"
"mountains far away to the right, they shouted as if in answer. Nunez"
"bawled again, and then once more, and as he gestured ineffectually the"
"word “blind” came up to the top of his thoughts. “The fools must be"
"blind,” he said."
"When at last, after much shouting and wrath, Nunez crossed the stream"
"by a little bridge, came through a gate in the wall, and approached"
"them, he was sure that they were blind. He was sure that this was the"
"Country of the Blind of which the legends told. Conviction had sprung"
"upon him, and a sense of great and rather enviable adventure. The three"
"stood side by side, not looking at him, but with their ears directed"
"towards him, judging him by his unfamiliar steps. They stood close"
"together like men a little afraid, and he could see their eyelids"
"closed and sunken, as though the very balls beneath had shrunk away."
"There was an expression near awe on their faces."
"“A man,” one said, in hardly recognisable Spanish. “A man it is—a man"
"or a spirit—coming down from the rocks.”"
"But Nunez advanced with the confident steps of a youth who enters upon"
"life. All the old stories of the lost valley and the Country of the"
"Blind had come back to his mind, and through his thoughts ran this old"
"proverb, as if it were a refrain:—"
"“In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.”"
"“In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.”"
"And very civilly he gave them greeting. He talked to them and used his"
"eyes."
"“Where does he come from, brother Pedro?” asked one."
"“Down out of the rocks.”"
"“Over the mountains I come,” said Nunez, “out of the country beyond"
"there—where men can see. From near Bogota—where there are a hundred"
"thousands of people, and where the city passes out of sight.”"
"“Sight?” muttered Pedro. “Sight?”"
"“He comes,” said the second blind man, “out of the rocks.”"
"The cloth of their coats, Nunez saw was curious fashioned, each with a"
"different sort of stitching."
"They startled him by a simultaneous movement towards him, each with a"
"hand outstretched. He stepped back from the advance of these spread"
"fingers."
"“Come hither,” said the third blind man, following his motion and"
"clutching him neatly."
"And they held Nunez and felt him over, saying no word further until"
"they had done so."
"“Carefully,” he cried, with a finger in his eye, and found they thought"
"that organ, with its fluttering lids, a queer thing in him. They went"
"over it again."
"“A strange creature, Correa,” said the one called Pedro. “Feel the"
"coarseness of his hair. Like a llama’s hair.”"
"“Rough he is as the rocks that begot him,” said Correa, investigating"
"Nunez’s unshaven chin with a soft and slightly moist hand. “Perhaps he"
"will grow finer.”"
"Nunez struggled a little under their examination, but they gripped him"
"firm."
"“Carefully,” he said again."
"“He speaks,” said the third man. “Certainly he is a man.”"
"“Ugh!” said Pedro, at the roughness of his coat."
"“And you have come into the world?” asked Pedro."
"“_Out_ of the world. Over mountains and glaciers; right over above"
"there, half-way to the sun. Out of the great, big world that goes down,"
"twelve days’ journey to the sea.”"
"They scarcely seemed to heed him. “Our fathers have told us men may be"
"made by the forces of Nature,” said Correa. “It is the warmth of"
"things, and moisture, and rottenness—rottenness.”"
"“Let us lead him to the elders,” said Pedro."
"“Shout first,” said Correa, “lest the children be afraid. This is a"
"marvellous occasion.”"
"So they shouted, and Pedro went first and took Nunez by the hand to"
"lead him to the houses."
"He drew his hand away. “I can see,” he said."
"“See?” said Correa."
"“Yes; see,” said Nunez, turning towards him, and stumbled against"
"Pedro’s pail."
"“His senses are still imperfect,” said the third blind man. “He"
"stumbles, and talks unmeaning words. Lead him by the hand.”"
"“As you will,” said Nunez, and was led along laughing."
"It seemed they knew nothing of sight."
"Well, all in good time he would teach them."
"He heard people shouting, and saw a number of figures gathering"
"together in the middle roadway of the village."
"He found it tax his nerve and patience more than he had anticipated,"
"that first encounter with the population of the Country of the Blind."
"The place seemed larger as he drew near to it, and the smeared"
"plasterings queerer, and a crowd of children and men and women (the"
"women and girls he was pleased to note had, some of them, quite sweet"
"faces, for all that their eyes were shut and sunken) came about him,"
"holding on to him, touching him with soft, sensitive hands, smelling at"
"him, and listening at every word he spoke. Some of the maidens and"
"children, however, kept aloof as if afraid, and indeed his voice seemed"
"coarse and rude beside their softer notes. They mobbed him. His three"
"guides kept close to him with an effect of proprietorship, and said"
"again and again, “A wild man out of the rocks.”"
"“Bogota,” he said. “Bogota. Over the mountain crests.”"
"“A wild man—using wild words,” said Pedro. “Did you hear that—"
"“_Bogota?_ His mind has hardly formed yet. He has only the beginnings"
"of speech.”"
"A little boy nipped his hand. “Bogota!” he said mockingly."
"“Aye! A city to your village. I come from the great world—where men"
"have eyes and see.”"
"“His name’s Bogota,” they said."
"“He stumbled,” said Correa—“stumbled twice as we came hither.”"
"“Bring him in to the elders.”"
"And they thrust him suddenly through a doorway into a room as black as"
"pitch, save at the end there faintly glowed a fire. The crowd closed in"
"behind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer of day, and before"
"he could arrest himself he had fallen headlong over the feet of a"
"seated man. His arm, outflung, struck the face of someone else as he"
"went down; he felt the soft impact of features and heard a cry of"
"anger, and for a moment he struggled against a number of hands that"
"clutched him. It was a one-sided fight. An inkling of the situation"
"came to him and he lay quiet."
"“I fell down,” he said; “I couldn’t see in this pitchy darkness.”"
"There was a pause as if the unseen persons about him tried to"
"understand his words. Then the voice of Correa said: “He is but newly"
"formed. He stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean nothing"
"with his speech.”"
"Others also said things about him that he heard or understood"
"imperfectly."
"“May I sit up?” he asked, in a pause. “I will not struggle against you"
"again.”"
"They consulted and let him rise."
"The voice of an older man began to question him, and Nunez found"
"himself trying to explain the great world out of which he had fallen,"
"and the sky and mountains and such-like marvels, to these elders who"
"sat in darkness in the Country of the Blind. And they would believe and"
"understand nothing whatever that he told them, a thing quite outside"
"his expectation. They would not even understand many of his words. For"
"fourteen generations these people had been blind and cut off from all"
"the seeing world; the names for all the things of sight had faded and"
"changed; the story of the outer world was faded and changed to a"
"child’s story; and they had ceased to concern themselves with anything"
"beyond the rocky slopes above their circling wall. Blind men of genius"
"had arisen among them and questioned the shreds of belief and tradition"
"they had brought with them from their seeing days, and had dismissed"
"all these things as idle fancies and replaced them with new and saner"
"explanations. Much of their imagination had shrivelled with their eyes,"
"and they had made for themselves new imaginations with their ever more"
"sensitive ears and finger-tips. Slowly Nunez realised this: that his"
"expectation of wonder and reverence at his origin and his gifts was not"
"to be borne out; and after his poor attempt to explain sight to them"
"had been set aside as the confused version of a new-made being"
"describing the marvels of his incoherent sensations, he subsided, a"
"little dashed, into listening to their instruction. And the eldest of"
"the blind men explained to him life and philosophy and religion, how"
"that the world (meaning their valley) had been first an empty hollow in"
"the rocks, and then had come first inanimate things without the gift of"
"touch, and llamas and a few other creatures that had little sense, and"
"then men, and at last angels, whom one could hear singing and making"
"fluttering sounds, but whom no one could touch at all, which puzzled"
"Nunez greatly until he thought of the birds."
"He went on to tell Nunez how this time had been divided into the warm"
"and the cold, which are the blind equivalents of day and night, and how"
"it was good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold, so that now,"
"but for his advent, the whole town of the blind would have been asleep."
"He said Nunez must have been specially created to learn and serve the"
"wisdom they had acquired, and that for all his mental incoherency and"
"stumbling behaviour he must have courage and do his best to learn, and"
"at that all the people in the door-way murmured encouragingly. He said"
"the night—for the blind call their day night—was now far gone, and it"
"behooved everyone to go back to sleep. He asked Nunez if he knew how to"
"sleep, and Nunez said he did, but that before sleep he wanted food."
"They brought him food, llama’s milk in a bowl and rough salted bread,"
"and led him into a lonely place to eat out of their hearing, and"
"afterwards to slumber until the chill of the mountain evening roused"
"them to begin their day again. But Nunez slumbered not at all."
"Instead, he sat up in the place where they had left him, resting his"
"limbs and turning the unanticipated circumstances of his arrival over"
"and over in his mind."
"Every now and then he laughed, sometimes with amusement and sometimes"
"with indignation."
"“Unformed mind!” he said. “Got no senses yet! They little know they’ve"
"been insulting their Heaven-sent King and master . . . . ."
"“I see I must bring them to reason."
"“Let me think."
"“Let me think.”"
"He was still thinking when the sun set."
"Nunez had an eye for all beautiful things, and it seemed to him that"
"the glow upon the snow-fields and glaciers that rose about the valley"
"on every side was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. His eyes"
"went from that inaccessible glory to the village and irrigated fields,"
"fast sinking into the twilight, and suddenly a wave of emotion took"
"him, and he thanked God from the bottom of his heart that the power of"
"sight had been given him."
"He heard a voice calling to him from out of the village."
"“Yaho there, Bogota! Come hither!”"
"At that he stood up, smiling. He would show these people once and for"
"all what sight would do for a man. They would seek him, but not find"
"him."
"“You move not, Bogota,” said the voice."
"He laughed noiselessly and made two stealthy steps aside from the path."
"“Trample not on the grass, Bogota; that is not allowed.”"
"Nunez had scarcely heard the sound he made himself. He stopped, amazed."
"The owner of the voice came running up the piebald path towards him."
"He stepped back into the pathway. “Here I am,” he said."
"“Why did you not come when I called you?” said the blind man. “Must you"
"be led like a child? Cannot you hear the path as you walk?”"
"Nunez laughed. “I can see it,” he said."
"“There is no such word as _see_,” said the blind man, after a pause."
"“Cease this folly and follow the sound of my feet.”"
"Nunez followed, a little annoyed."
"“My time will come,” he said."
"“You’ll learn,” the blind man answered. “There is much to learn in the"
"world.”"
"“Has no one told you, ‘In the Country of the Blind the One-Eyed Man is"
"King?’”"
"“What is blind?” asked the blind man, carelessly, over his shoulder."
"Four days passed and the fifth found the King of the Blind still"
"incognito, as a clumsy and useless stranger among his subjects."
"It was, he found, much more difficult to proclaim himself than he had"
"supposed, and in the meantime, while he meditated his _coup d’etat_, he"
"did what he was told and learnt the manners and customs of the Country"
"of the Blind. He found working and going about at night a particularly"
"irksome thing, and he decided that that should be the first thing he"
"would change."
"They led a simple, laborious life, these people, with all the elements"
"of virtue and happiness as these things can be understood by men. They"
"toiled, but not oppressively; they had food and clothing sufficient for"
"their needs; they had days and seasons of rest; they made much of music"
"and singing, and there was love among them and little children. It was"
"marvellous with what confidence and precision they went about their"
"ordered world. Everything, you see, had been made to fit their needs;"
"each of the radiating paths of the valley area had a constant angle to"
"the others, and was distinguished by a special notch upon its kerbing;"
"all obstacles and irregularities of path or meadow had long since been"
"cleared away; all their methods and procedure arose naturally from"
"their special needs. Their senses had become marvellously acute; they"
"could hear and judge the slightest gesture of a man a dozen paces"
"away—could hear the very beating of his heart. Intonation had long"
"replaced expression with them, and touches gesture, and their work with"
"hoe and spade and fork was as free and confident as garden work can be."
"Their sense of smell was extraordinarily fine; they could distinguish"
"individual differences as readily as a dog can, and they went about the"
"tending of llamas, who lived among the rocks above and came to the wall"
"for food and shelter, with ease and confidence. It was only when at"
"last Nunez sought to assert himself that he found how easy and"
"confident their movements could be."
"He rebelled only after he had tried persuasion."
"He tried at first on several occasions to tell them of sight. “Look you"
"here, you people,” he said. “There are things you do not understand in"
"me.”"
"Once or twice one or two of them attended to him; they sat with faces"
"downcast and ears turned intelligently towards him, and he did his best"
"to tell them what it was to see. Among his hearers was a girl, with"
"eyelids less red and sunken than the others, so that one could almost"
"fancy she was hiding eyes, whom especially he hoped to persuade. He"
"spoke of the beauties of sight, of watching the mountains, of the sky"
"and the sunrise, and they heard him with amused incredulity that"
"presently became condemnatory. They told him there were indeed no"
"mountains at all, but that the end of the rocks where the llamas grazed"
"was indeed the end of the world; thence sprang a cavernous roof of the"
"universe, from which the dew and the avalanches fell; and when he"
"maintained stoutly the world had neither end nor roof such as they"
"supposed, they said his thoughts were wicked. So far as he could"
"describe sky and clouds and stars to them it seemed to them a hideous"
"void, a terrible blankness in the place of the smooth roof to things in"
"which they believed—it was an article of faith with them that the"
"cavern roof was exquisitely smooth to the touch. He saw that in some"
"manner he shocked them, and gave up that aspect of the matter"
"altogether, and tried to show them the practical value of sight. One"
"morning he saw Pedro in the path called Seventeen and coming towards"
"the central houses, but still too far off for hearing or scent, and he"
"told them as much. “In a little while,” he prophesied, “Pedro will be"
"here.” An old man remarked that Pedro had no business on path"
"Seventeen, and then, as if in confirmation, that individual as he drew"
"near turned and went transversely into path Ten, and so back with"
"nimble paces towards the outer wall. They mocked Nunez when Pedro did"
"not arrive, and afterwards, when he asked Pedro questions to clear his"
"character, Pedro denied and outfaced him, and was afterwards hostile to"
"him."
"Then he induced them to let him go a long way up the sloping meadows"
"towards the wall with one complaisant individual, and to him he"
"promised to describe all that happened among the houses. He noted"
"certain goings and comings, but the things that really seemed to"
"signify to these people happened inside of or behind the windowless"
"houses—the only things they took note of to test him by—and of those he"
"could see or tell nothing; and it was after the failure of this"
"attempt, and the ridicule they could not repress, that he resorted to"
"force. He thought of seizing a spade and suddenly smiting one or two of"
"them to earth, and so in fair combat showing the advantage of eyes. He"
"went so far with that resolution as to seize his spade, and then he"
"discovered a new thing about himself, and that was that it was"
"impossible for him to hit a blind man in cold blood."
"He hesitated, and found them all aware that he had snatched up the"
"spade. They stood all alert, with their heads on one side, and bent"
"ears towards him for what he would do next."
"“Put that spade down,” said one, and he felt a sort of helpless horror."
"He came near obedience."
"Then he had thrust one backwards against a house wall, and fled past"
"him and out of the village."
"He went athwart one of their meadows, leaving a track of trampled grass"
"behind his feet, and presently sat down by the side of one of their"
"ways. He felt something of the buoyancy that comes to all men in the"
"beginning of a fight, but more perplexity. He began to realise that you"
"cannot even fight happily with creatures who stand upon a different"
"mental basis to yourself. Far away he saw a number of men carrying"
"spades and sticks come out of the street of houses and advance in a"
"spreading line along the several paths towards him. They advanced"
"slowly, speaking frequently to one another, and ever and again the"
"whole cordon would halt and sniff the air and listen."
"The first time they did this Nunez laughed. But afterwards he did not"
"laugh."
"One struck his trail in the meadow grass and came stooping and feeling"
"his way along it."
"For five minutes he watched the slow extension of the cordon, and then"
"his vague disposition to do something forthwith became frantic. He"
"stood up, went a pace or so towards the circumferential wall, turned,"
"and went back a little way. There they all stood in a crescent, still"
"and listening."
"He also stood still, gripping his spade very tightly in both hands."
"Should he charge them?"
"The pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of “In the Country of the"
"Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.”"
"Should he charge them?"
"He looked back at the high and unclimbable wall behind—unclimbable"
"because of its smooth plastering, but withal pierced with many little"
"doors and at the approaching line of seekers. Behind these others were"
"now coming out of the street of houses."
"Should he charge them?"
"“Bogota!” called one. “Bogota! where are you?”"
"He gripped his spade still tighter and advanced down the meadows"
"towards the place of habitations, and directly he moved they converged"
"upon him. “I’ll hit them if they touch me,” he swore; “by Heaven, I"
"will. I’ll hit.” He called aloud, “Look here, I’m going to do what I"
"like in this valley! Do you hear? I’m going to do what I like and go"
"where I like.”"
"They were moving in upon him quickly, groping, yet moving rapidly. It"
"was like playing blind man’s buff with everyone blindfolded except one."
"“Get hold of him!” cried one. He found himself in the arc of a loose"
"curve of pursuers. He felt suddenly he must be active and resolute."
"“You don’t understand,” he cried, in a voice that was meant to be great"
"and resolute, and which broke. “You are blind and I can see. Leave me"
"alone!”"
"“Bogota! Put down that spade and come off the grass!”"
"The last order, grotesque in its urban familiarity, produced a gust of"
"anger. “I’ll hurt you,” he said, sobbing with emotion. “By Heaven, I’ll"
"hurt you! Leave me alone!”"
"He began to run—not knowing clearly where to run. He ran from the"
"nearest blind man, because it was a horror to hit him. He stopped, and"
"then made a dash to escape from their closing ranks. He made for where"
"a gap was wide, and the men on either side, with a quick perception of"
"the approach of his paces, rushed in on one another. He sprang forward,"
"and then saw he must be caught, and _swish!_ the spade had struck. He"
"felt the soft thud of hand and arm, and the man was down with a yell of"
"pain, and he was through."
"Through! And then he was close to the street of houses again, and blind"
"men, whirling spades and stakes, were running with a reasoned swiftness"
"hither and thither."
"He heard steps behind him just in time, and found a tall man rushing"
"forward and swiping at the sound of him. He lost his nerve, hurled his"
"spade a yard wide of this antagonist, and whirled about and fled,"
"fairly yelling as he dodged another."
"He was panic-stricken. He ran furiously to and fro, dodging when there"
"was no need to dodge, and, in his anxiety to see on every side of him"
"at once, stumbling. For a moment he was down and they heard his fall."
"Far away in the circumferential wall a little doorway looked like"
"Heaven, and he set off in a wild rush for it. He did not even look"
"round at his pursuers until it was gained, and he had stumbled across"
"the bridge, clambered a little way among the rocks, to the surprise and"
"dismay of a young llama, who went leaping out of sight, and lay down"
"sobbing for breath."
"And so his _coup d’etat_ came to an end."
"He stayed outside the wall of the valley of the blind for two nights"
"and days without food or shelter, and meditated upon the Unexpected."
"During these meditations he repeated very frequently and always with a"
"profounder note of derision the exploded proverb: “In the Country of"
"the Blind the One-Eyed Man is King.” He thought chiefly of ways of"
"fighting and conquering these people, and it grew clear that for him no"
"practicable way was possible. He had no weapons, and now it would be"
"hard to get one."
"The canker of civilisation had got to him even in Bogota, and he could"
"not find it in himself to go down and assassinate a blind man. Of"
"course, if he did that, he might then dictate terms on the threat of"
"assassinating them all. But—Sooner or later he must sleep! . . . ."
"He tried also to find food among the pine trees, to be comfortable"
"under pine boughs while the frost fell at night, and—with less"
"confidence—to catch a llama by artifice in order to try to kill"
"it—perhaps by hammering it with a stone—and so finally, perhaps, to eat"
"some of it. But the llamas had a doubt of him and regarded him with"
"distrustful brown eyes and spat when he drew near. Fear came on him the"
"second day and fits of shivering. Finally he crawled down to the wall"
"of the Country of the Blind and tried to make his terms. He crawled"
"along by the stream, shouting, until two blind men came out to the gate"
"and talked to him."
"“I was mad,” he said. “But I was only newly made.”"
"They said that was better."
"He told them he was wiser now, and repented of all he had done."
"Then he wept without intention, for he was very weak and ill now, and"
"they took that as a favourable sign."
"They asked him if he still thought he could “_see_.”"
"“No,” he said. “That was folly. The word means nothing. Less than"
"nothing!”"
"They asked him what was overhead."
"“About ten times ten the height of a man there is a roof above the"
"world—of rock—and very, very smooth. So smooth—so beautifully smooth ."
".” He burst again into hysterical tears. “Before you ask me any more,"
"give me some food or I shall die!”"
"He expected dire punishments, but these blind people were capable of"
"toleration. They regarded his rebellion as but one more proof of his"
"general idiocy and inferiority, and after they had whipped him they"
"appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work they had for anyone"
"to do, and he, seeing no other way of living, did submissively what he"
"was told."
"He was ill for some days and they nursed him kindly. That refined his"
"submission. But they insisted on his lying in the dark, and that was a"
"great misery. And blind philosophers came and talked to him of the"
"wicked levity of his mind, and reproved him so impressively for his"
"doubts about the lid of rock that covered their cosmic _casserole_ that"
"he almost doubted whether indeed he was not the victim of hallucination"
"in not seeing it overhead."
"So Nunez became a citizen of the Country of the Blind, and these people"
"ceased to be a generalised people and became individualities to him,"
"and familiar to him, while the world beyond the mountains became more"
"and more remote and unreal. There was Yacob, his master, a kindly man"
"when not annoyed; there was Pedro, Yacob’s nephew; and there was"
"Medina-sarote, who was the youngest daughter of Yacob. She was little"
"esteemed in the world of the blind, because she had a clear-cut face"
"and lacked that satisfying, glossy smoothness that is the blind man’s"
"ideal of feminine beauty, but Nunez thought her beautiful at first, and"
"presently the most beautiful thing in the whole creation. Her closed"
"eyelids were not sunken and red after the common way of the valley, but"
"lay as though they might open again at any moment; and she had long"
"eyelashes, which were considered a grave disfigurement. And her voice"
"was weak and did not satisfy the acute hearing of the valley swains. So"
"that she had no lover."
"There came a time when Nunez thought that, could he win her, he would"
"be resigned to live in the valley for all the rest of his days."
"He watched her; he sought opportunities of doing her little services"
"and presently he found that she observed him. Once at a rest-day"
"gathering they sat side by side in the dim starlight, and the music was"
"sweet. His hand came upon hers and he dared to clasp it. Then very"
"tenderly she returned his pressure. And one day, as they were at their"
"meal in the darkness, he felt her hand very softly seeking him, and as"
"it chanced the fire leapt then, and he saw the tenderness of her face."
"He sought to speak to her."
"He went to her one day when she was sitting in the summer moonlight"
"spinning. The light made her a thing of silver and mystery. He sat down"
"at her feet and told her he loved her, and told her how beautiful she"
"seemed to him. He had a lover’s voice, he spoke with a tender reverence"
"that came near to awe, and she had never before been touched by"
"adoration. She made him no definite answer, but it was clear his words"
"pleased her."
"After that he talked to her whenever he could take an opportunity. The"
"valley became the world for him, and the world beyond the mountains"
"where men lived by day seemed no more than a fairy tale he would some"
"day pour into her ears. Very tentatively and timidly he spoke to her of"
"sight."
"Sight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies, and she listened to"
"his description of the stars and the mountains and her own sweet"
"white-lit beauty as though it was a guilty indulgence. She did not"
"believe, she could only half understand, but she was mysteriously"
"delighted, and it seemed to him that she completely understood."
"His love lost its awe and took courage. Presently he was for demanding"
"her of Yacob and the elders in marriage, but she became fearful and"
"delayed. And it was one of her elder sisters who first told Yacob that"
"Medina-sarote and Nunez were in love."
"There was from the first very great opposition to the marriage of Nunez"
"and Medina-sarote; not so much because they valued her as because they"
"held him as a being apart, an idiot, incompetent thing below the"
"permissible level of a man. Her sisters opposed it bitterly as bringing"
"discredit on them all; and old Yacob, though he had formed a sort of"
"liking for his clumsy, obedient serf, shook his head and said the thing"
"could not be. The young men were all angry at the idea of corrupting"
"the race, and one went so far as to revile and strike Nunez. He struck"
"back. Then for the first time he found an advantage in seeing, even by"
"twilight, and after that fight was over no one was disposed to raise a"
"hand against him. But they still found his marriage impossible."
"Old Yacob had a tenderness for his last little daughter, and was"
"grieved to have her weep upon his shoulder."
"“You see, my dear, he’s an idiot. He has delusions; he can’t do"
"anything right.”"
"“I know,” wept Medina-sarote. “But he’s better than he was. He’s"
"getting better. And he’s strong, dear father, and kind—stronger and"
"kinder than any other man in the world. And he loves me—and, father, I"
"love him.”"
"Old Yacob was greatly distressed to find her inconsolable, and,"
"besides—what made it more distressing—he liked Nunez for many things."
"So he went and sat in the windowless council-chamber with the other"
"elders and watched the trend of the talk, and said, at the proper time,"
"“He’s better than he was. Very likely, some day, we shall find him as"
"sane as ourselves.”"
"Then afterwards one of the elders, who thought deeply, had an idea. He"
"was a great doctor among these people, their medicine-man, and he had a"
"very philosophical and inventive mind, and the idea of curing Nunez of"
"his peculiarities appealed to him. One day when Yacob was present he"
"returned to the topic of Nunez. “I have examined Nunez,” he said, “and"
"the case is clearer to me. I think very probably he might be cured.”"
"“This is what I have always hoped,” said old Yacob."
"“His brain is affected,” said the blind doctor."
"The elders murmured assent."
"“Now, _what_ affects it?”"
"“Ah!” said old Yacob."
"“_This_,” said the doctor, answering his own question. “Those queer"
"things that are called the eyes, and which exist to make an agreeable"
"depression in the face, are diseased, in the case of Nunez, in such a"
"way as to affect his brain. They are greatly distended, he has"
"eyelashes, and his eyelids move, and consequently his brain is in a"
"state of constant irritation and distraction.”"
"“Yes?” said old Yacob. “Yes?”"
"“And I think I may say with reasonable certainty that, in order to cure"
"him complete, all that we need to do is a simple and easy surgical"
"operation—namely, to remove these irritant bodies.”"
"“And then he will be sane?”"
"“Then he will be perfectly sane, and a quite admirable citizen.”"
"“Thank Heaven for science!” said old Yacob, and went forth at once to"
"tell Nunez of his happy hopes."
"But Nunez’s manner of receiving the good news struck him as being cold"
"and disappointing."
"“One might think,” he said, “from the tone you take that you did not"
"care for my daughter.”"
"It was Medina-sarote who persuaded Nunez to face the blind surgeons."
"“_You_ do not want me,” he said, “to lose my gift of sight?”"
"She shook her head."
"“My world is sight.”"
"Her head drooped lower."
"“There are the beautiful things, the beautiful little things—the"
"flowers, the lichens amidst the rocks, the light and softness on a"
"piece of fur, the far sky with its drifting dawn of clouds, the sunsets"
"and the stars. And there is _you_. For you alone it is good to have"
"sight, to see your sweet, serene face, your kindly lips, your dear,"
"beautiful hands folded together. . . . . It is these eyes of mine you"
"won, these eyes that hold me to you, that these idiots seek. Instead, I"
"must touch you, hear you, and never see you again. I must come under"
"that roof of rock and stone and darkness, that horrible roof under"
"which your imaginations stoop . . . _No_; _you_ would not have me do"
"that?”"
"A disagreeable doubt had arisen in him. He stopped and left the thing a"
"question."
"“I wish,” she said, “sometimes—” She paused."
"“Yes?” he said, a little apprehensively."
"“I wish sometimes—you would not talk like that.”"
"“Like what?”"
"“I know it’s pretty—it’s your imagination. I love it, but _now_—”"
"He felt cold. “_Now?_” he said, faintly."
"She sat quite still."
"“You mean—you think—I should be better, better perhaps—”"
"He was realising things very swiftly. He felt anger perhaps, anger at"
"the dull course of fate, but also sympathy for her lack of"
"understanding—a sympathy near akin to pity."
"“_Dear_,” he said, and he could see by her whiteness how tensely her"
"spirit pressed against the things she could not say. He put his arms"
"about her, he kissed her ear, and they sat for a time in silence."
"“If I were to consent to this?” he said at last, in a voice that was"
"very gentle."
"She flung her arms about him, weeping wildly. “Oh, if you would,” she"
"sobbed, “if only you would!”"
"For a week before the operation that was to raise him from his"
"servitude and inferiority to the level of a blind citizen Nunez knew"
"nothing of sleep, and all through the warm, sunlit hours, while the"
"others slumbered happily, he sat brooding or wandered aimlessly, trying"
"to bring his mind to bear on his dilemma. He had given his answer, he"
"had given his consent, and still he was not sure. And at last work-time"
"was over, the sun rose in splendour over the golden crests, and his"
"last day of vision began for him. He had a few minutes with"
"Medina-sarote before she went apart to sleep."
"“To-morrow,” he said, “I shall see no more.”"
"“Dear heart!” she answered, and pressed his hands with all her"
"strength."
"“They will hurt you but little,” she said; “and you are going through"
"this pain, you are going through it, dear lover, for _me_ . . . . Dear,"
"if a woman’s heart and life can do it, I will repay you. My dearest"
"one, my dearest with the tender voice, I will repay.”"
"He was drenched in pity for himself and her."
"He held her in his arms, and pressed his lips to hers and looked on her"
"sweet face for the last time. “Good-bye!” he whispered to that dear"
"sight, “good-bye!”"
"And then in silence he turned away from her."
"She could hear his slow retreating footsteps, and something in the"
"rhythm of them threw her into a passion of weeping."
"He walked away."
"He had fully meant to go to a lonely place where the meadows were"
"beautiful with white narcissus, and there remain until the hour of his"
"sacrifice should come, but as he walked he lifted up his eyes and saw"
"the morning, the morning like an angel in golden armour, marching down"
"the steeps . . . ."
"It seemed to him that before this splendour he and this blind world in"
"the valley, and his love and all, were no more than a pit of sin."
"He did not turn aside as he had meant to do, but went on and passed"
"through the wall of the circumference and out upon the rocks, and his"
"eyes were always upon the sunlit ice and snow."
"He saw their infinite beauty, and his imagination soared over them to"
"the things beyond he was now to resign for ever!"
"He thought of that great free world that he was parted from, the world"
"that was his own, and he had a vision of those further slopes, distance"
"beyond distance, with Bogota, a place of multitudinous stirring beauty,"
"a glory by day, a luminous mystery by night, a place of palaces and"
"fountains and statues and white houses, lying beautifully in the middle"
"distance. He thought how for a day or so one might come down through"
"passes drawing ever nearer and nearer to its busy streets and ways. He"
"thought of the river journey, day by day, from great Bogota to the"
"still vaster world beyond, through towns and villages, forest and"
"desert places, the rushing river day by day, until its banks receded,"
"and the big steamers came splashing by and one had reached the sea—the"
"limitless sea, with its thousand islands, its thousands of islands, and"
"its ships seen dimly far away in their incessant journeyings round and"
"about that greater world. And there, unpent by mountains, one saw the"
"sky—the sky, not such a disc as one saw it here, but an arch of"
"immeasurable blue, a deep of deeps in which the circling stars were"
"floating . . . ."
"His eyes began to scrutinise the great curtain of the mountains with a"
"keener inquiry."
"For example; if one went so, up that gully and to that chimney there,"
"then one might come out high among those stunted pines that ran round"
"in a sort of shelf and rose still higher and higher as it passed above"
"the gorge. And then? That talus might be managed. Thence perhaps a"
"climb might be found to take him up to the precipice that came below"
"the snow; and if that chimney failed, then another farther to the east"
"might serve his purpose better. And then? Then one would be out upon"
"the amber-lit snow there, and half-way up to the crest of those"
"beautiful desolations. And suppose one had good fortune!"
"He glanced back at the village, then turned right round and regarded it"
"with folded arms."
"He thought of Medina-sarote, and she had become small and remote."
"He turned again towards the mountain wall down which the day had come"
"to him."
"Then very circumspectly he began his climb."
"When sunset came he was not longer climbing, but he was far and high."
"His clothes were torn, his limbs were bloodstained, he was bruised in"
"many places, but he lay as if he were at his ease, and there was a"
"smile on his face."
"From where he rested the valley seemed as if it were in a pit and"
"nearly a mile below. Already it was dim with haze and shadow, though"
"the mountain summits around him were things of light and fire. The"
"mountain summits around him were things of light and fire, and the"
"little things in the rocks near at hand were drenched with light and"
"beauty, a vein of green mineral piercing the grey, a flash of small"
"crystal here and there, a minute, minutely-beautiful orange lichen"
"close beside his face. There were deep, mysterious shadows in the"
"gorge, blue deepening into purple, and purple into a luminous darkness,"
"and overhead was the illimitable vastness of the sky. But he heeded"
"these things no longer, but lay quite still there, smiling as if he"
"were content now merely to have escaped from the valley of the Blind,"
"in which he had thought to be King. And the glow of the sunset passed,"
"and the night came, and still he lay there, under the cold, clear"
"stars."

"CHAPTER THE FIRST"
"ANN VERONICA TALKS TO HER FATHER"
"Part 1"
"One Wednesday afternoon in late September, Ann Veronica Stanley came"
"down from London in a state of solemn excitement and quite resolved to"
"have things out with her father that very evening. She had trembled on"
"the verge of such a resolution before, but this time quite definitely"
"she made it. A crisis had been reached, and she was almost glad it had"
"been reached. She made up her mind in the train home that it should be"
"a decisive crisis. It is for that reason that this novel begins with"
"her there, and neither earlier nor later, for it is the history of this"
"crisis and its consequences that this novel has to tell."
"She had a compartment to herself in the train from London to Morningside"
"Park, and she sat with both her feet on the seat in an attitude that"
"would certainly have distressed her mother to see, and horrified her"
"grandmother beyond measure; she sat with her knees up to her chin and"
"her hands clasped before them, and she was so lost in thought that"
"she discovered with a start, from a lettered lamp, that she was at"
"Morningside Park, and thought she was moving out of the station, whereas"
"she was only moving in. \"Lord!\" she said. She jumped up at once,"
"caught up a leather clutch containing notebooks, a fat text-book, and"
"a chocolate-and-yellow-covered pamphlet, and leaped neatly from the"
"carriage, only to discover that the train was slowing down and that she"
"had to traverse the full length of the platform past it again as the"
"result of her precipitation. \"Sold again,\" she remarked. \"Idiot!\" She"
"raged inwardly while she walked along with that air of self-contained"
"serenity that is proper to a young lady of nearly two-and-twenty under"
"the eye of the world."
"She walked down the station approach, past the neat, obtrusive offices"
"of the coal merchant and the house agent, and so to the wicket-gate by"
"the butcher's shop that led to the field path to her home. Outside the"
"post-office stood a no-hatted, blond young man in gray flannels, who was"
"elaborately affixing a stamp to a letter. At the sight of her he became"
"rigid and a singularly bright shade of pink. She made herself serenely"
"unaware of his existence, though it may be it was his presence that sent"
"her by the field detour instead of by the direct path up the Avenue."
"\"Umph!\" he said, and regarded his letter doubtfully before consigning it"
"to the pillar-box. \"Here goes,\" he said. Then he hovered undecidedly for"
"some seconds with his hands in his pockets and his mouth puckered to a"
"whistle before he turned to go home by the Avenue."
"Ann Veronica forgot him as soon as she was through the gate, and her"
"face resumed its expression of stern preoccupation. \"It's either now or"
"never,\" she said to herself...."
"Morningside Park was a suburb that had not altogether, as people say,"
"come off. It consisted, like pre-Roman Gaul, of three parts. There was"
"first the Avenue, which ran in a consciously elegant curve from the"
"railway station into an undeveloped wilderness of agriculture, with big,"
"yellow brick villas on either side, and then there was the pavement, the"
"little clump of shops about the post-office, and under the railway arch"
"was a congestion of workmen's dwellings. The road from Surbiton and"
"Epsom ran under the arch, and, like a bright fungoid growth in the"
"ditch, there was now appearing a sort of fourth estate of little"
"red-and-white rough-cast villas, with meretricious gables and very"
"brassy window-blinds. Behind the Avenue was a little hill, and an"
"iron-fenced path went over the crest of this to a stile under an"
"elm-tree, and forked there, with one branch going back into the Avenue"
"again."
"\"It's either now or never,\" said Ann Veronica, again ascending this"
"stile. \"Much as I hate rows, I've either got to make a stand or give in"
"altogether.\""
"She seated herself in a loose and easy attitude and surveyed the"
"backs of the Avenue houses; then her eyes wandered to where the new"
"red-and-white villas peeped among the trees. She seemed to be making"
"some sort of inventory. \"Ye Gods!\" she said at last. \"WHAT a place!"
"\"Stuffy isn't the word for it."
"\"I wonder what he takes me for?\""
"When presently she got down from the stile a certain note of internal"
"conflict, a touch of doubt, had gone from her warm-tinted face. She had"
"now the clear and tranquil expression of one whose mind is made up. Her"
"back had stiffened, and her hazel eyes looked steadfastly ahead."
"As she approached the corner of the Avenue the blond, no-hatted man in"
"gray flannels appeared. There was a certain air of forced fortuity in"
"his manner. He saluted awkwardly. \"Hello, Vee!\" he said."
"\"Hello, Teddy!\" she answered."
"He hung vaguely for a moment as she passed."
"But it was clear she was in no mood for Teddys. He realized that he was"
"committed to the path across the fields, an uninteresting walk at the"
"best of times."
"\"Oh, dammit!\" he remarked, \"dammit!\" with great bitterness as he faced"
"it."
"Part 2"
"Ann Veronica Stanley was twenty-one and a half years old. She had black"
"hair, fine eyebrows, and a clear complexion; and the forces that had"
"modelled her features had loved and lingered at their work and made them"
"subtle and fine. She was slender, and sometimes she seemed tall, and"
"walked and carried herself lightly and joyfully as one who commonly"
"and habitually feels well, and sometimes she stooped a little and"
"was preoccupied. Her lips came together with an expression between"
"contentment and the faintest shadow of a smile, her manner was one of"
"quiet reserve, and behind this mask she was wildly discontented and"
"eager for freedom and life."
"She wanted to live. She was vehemently impatient--she did not clearly"
"know for what--to do, to be, to experience. And experience was slow in"
"coming. All the world about her seemed to be--how can one put it?--in"
"wrappers, like a house when people leave it in the summer. The blinds"
"were all drawn, the sunlight kept out, one could not tell what"
"colors these gray swathings hid. She wanted to know. And there was no"
"intimation whatever that the blinds would ever go up or the windows or"
"doors be opened, or the chandeliers, that seemed to promise such a blaze"
"of fire, unveiled and furnished and lit. Dim souls flitted about her,"
"not only speaking but it would seem even thinking in undertones...."
"During her school days, especially her earlier school days, the world"
"had been very explicit with her, telling her what to do, what not to do,"
"giving her lessons to learn and games to play and interests of the most"
"suitable and various kinds. Presently she woke up to the fact that there"
"was a considerable group of interests called being in love and getting"
"married, with certain attractive and amusing subsidiary developments,"
"such as flirtation and \"being interested\" in people of the opposite sex."
"She approached this field with her usual liveliness of apprehension. But"
"here she met with a check. These interests her world promptly, through"
"the agency of schoolmistresses, older school-mates, her aunt, and a"
"number of other responsible and authoritative people, assured her she"
"must on no account think about. Miss Moffatt, the history and moral"
"instruction mistress, was particularly explicit upon this score, and"
"they all agreed in indicating contempt and pity for girls whose minds"
"ran on such matters, and who betrayed it in their conversation or dress"
"or bearing. It was, in fact, a group of interests quite unlike any"
"other group, peculiar and special, and one to be thoroughly ashamed of."
"Nevertheless, Ann Veronica found it a difficult matter not to think of"
"these things. However having a considerable amount of pride, she decided"
"she would disavow these undesirable topics and keep her mind away from"
"them just as far as she could, but it left her at the end of her school"
"days with that wrapped feeling I have described, and rather at loose"
"ends."
"The world, she discovered, with these matters barred had no particular"
"place for her at all, nothing for her to do, except a functionless"
"existence varied by calls, tennis, selected novels, walks, and dusting"
"in her father's house. She thought study would be better. She was a"
"clever girl, the best of her year in the High School, and she made"
"a valiant fight for Somerville or Newnham but her father had met and"
"argued with a Somerville girl at a friend's dinner-table and he thought"
"that sort of thing unsexed a woman. He said simply that he wanted her to"
"live at home. There was a certain amount of disputation, and meanwhile"
"she went on at school. They compromised at length on the science course"
"at the Tredgold Women's College--she had already matriculated into"
"London University from school--she came of age, and she bickered with"
"her aunt for latch-key privileges on the strength of that and her season"
"ticket. Shamefaced curiosities began to come back into her mind, thinly"
"disguised as literature and art. She read voraciously, and presently,"
"because of her aunt's censorship, she took to smuggling any books she"
"thought might be prohibited instead of bringing them home openly, and"
"she went to the theatre whenever she could produce an acceptable friend"
"to accompany her. She passed her general science examination with double"
"honors and specialized in science. She happened to have an acute sense"
"of form and unusual mental lucidity, and she found in biology, and"
"particularly in comparative anatomy, a very considerable interest,"
"albeit the illumination it cast upon her personal life was not"
"altogether direct. She dissected well, and in a year she found herself"
"chafing at the limitations of the lady B. Sc. who retailed a store of"
"faded learning in the Tredgold laboratory. She had already realized that"
"this instructress was hopelessly wrong and foggy--it is the test of the"
"good comparative anatomist--upon the skull. She discovered a desire to"
"enter as a student in the Imperial College at Westminster, where Russell"
"taught, and go on with her work at the fountain-head."
"She had asked about that already, and her father had replied, evasively:"
"\"We'll have to see about that, little Vee; we'll have to see about"
"that.\" In that posture of being seen about the matter hung until she"
"seemed committed to another session at the Tredgold College, and in the"
"mean time a small conflict arose and brought the latch-key question, and"
"in fact the question of Ann Veronica's position generally, to an acute"
"issue."
"In addition to the various business men, solicitors, civil servants,"
"and widow ladies who lived in the Morningside Park Avenue, there was a"
"certain family of alien sympathies and artistic quality, the Widgetts,"
"with which Ann Veronica had become very friendly. Mr. Widgett was a"
"journalist and art critic, addicted to a greenish-gray tweed suit"
"and \"art\" brown ties; he smoked corncob pipes in the Avenue on Sunday"
"morning, travelled third class to London by unusual trains, and openly"
"despised golf. He occupied one of the smaller houses near the station."
"He had one son, who had been co-educated, and three daughters with"
"peculiarly jolly red hair that Ann Veronica found adorable. Two of these"
"had been her particular intimates at the High School, and had done much"
"to send her mind exploring beyond the limits of the available literature"
"at home. It was a cheerful, irresponsible, shamelessly hard-up family in"
"the key of faded green and flattened purple, and the girls went on from"
"the High School to the Fadden Art School and a bright, eventful life of"
"art student dances, Socialist meetings, theatre galleries, talking about"
"work, and even, at intervals, work; and ever and again they drew Ann"
"Veronica from her sound persistent industry into the circle of these"
"experiences. They had asked her to come to the first of the two great"
"annual Fadden Dances, the October one, and Ann Veronica had accepted"
"with enthusiasm. And now her father said she must not go."
"He had \"put his foot down,\" and said she must not go."
"Going involved two things that all Ann Veronica's tact had been"
"ineffectual to conceal from her aunt and father. Her usual dignified"
"reserve had availed her nothing. One point was that she was to wear"
"fancy dress in the likeness of a Corsair's bride, and the other was that"
"she was to spend whatever vestiges of the night remained after the dance"
"was over in London with the Widgett girls and a select party in \"quite a"
"decent little hotel\" near Fitzroy Square."
"\"But, my dear!\" said Ann Veronica's aunt."
"\"You see,\" said Ann Veronica, with the air of one who shares a"
"difficulty, \"I've promised to go. I didn't realize--I don't see how I"
"can get out of it now.\""
"Then it was her father issued his ultimatum. He had conveyed it to her,"
"not verbally, but by means of a letter, which seemed to her a singularly"
"ignoble method of prohibition. \"He couldn't look me in the face and say"
"it,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"But of course it's aunt's doing really.\""
"And thus it was that as Ann Veronica neared the gates of home, she said"
"to herself: \"I'll have it out with him somehow. I'll have it out with"
"him. And if he won't--\""
"But she did not give even unspoken words to the alternative at that"
"time."
"Part 3"
"Ann Veronica's father was a solicitor with a good deal of company"
"business: a lean, trustworthy, worried-looking, neuralgic, clean-shaven"
"man of fifty-three, with a hard mouth, a sharp nose, iron-gray hair,"
"gray eyes, gold-framed glasses, and a small, circular baldness at the"
"crown of his head. His name was Peter. He had had five children at"
"irregular intervals, of whom Ann Veronica was the youngest, so that as"
"a parent he came to her perhaps a little practised and jaded and"
"inattentive; and he called her his \"little Vee,\" and patted her"
"unexpectedly and disconcertingly, and treated her promiscuously as of"
"any age between eleven and eight-and-twenty. The City worried him a good"
"deal, and what energy he had left over he spent partly in golf, a game"
"he treated very seriously, and partly in the practices of microscopic"
"petrography."
"He \"went in\" for microscopy in the unphilosophical Victorian manner as"
"his \"hobby.\" A birthday present of a microscope had turned his mind to"
"technical microscopy when he was eighteen, and a chance friendship with"
"a Holborn microscope dealer had confirmed that bent. He had remarkably"
"skilful fingers and a love of detailed processes, and he had become one"
"of the most dexterous amateur makers of rock sections in the world."
"He spent a good deal more money and time than he could afford upon the"
"little room at the top of the house, in producing new lapidary apparatus"
"and new microscopic accessories and in rubbing down slices of rock to"
"a transparent thinness and mounting them in a beautiful and dignified"
"manner. He did it, he said, \"to distract his mind.\" His chief successes"
"he exhibited to the Lowndean Microscopical Society, where their high"
"technical merit never failed to excite admiration. Their scientific"
"value was less considerable, since he chose rocks entirely with a"
"view to their difficulty of handling or their attractiveness at"
"conversaziones when done. He had a great contempt for the sections the"
"\"theorizers\" produced. They proved all sorts of things perhaps, but they"
"were thick, unequal, pitiful pieces of work. Yet an indiscriminating,"
"wrong-headed world gave such fellows all sorts of distinctions...."
"He read but little, and that chiefly healthy light fiction with"
"chromatic titles, The Red Sword, The Black Helmet, The Purple Robe, also"
"in order \"to distract his mind.\" He read it in winter in the evening"
"after dinner, and Ann Veronica associated it with a tendency to"
"monopolize the lamp, and to spread a very worn pair of dappled fawn-skin"
"slippers across the fender. She wondered occasionally why his mind"
"needed so much distraction. His favorite newspaper was the Times, which"
"he began at breakfast in the morning often with manifest irritation, and"
"carried off to finish in the train, leaving no other paper at home."
"It occurred to Ann Veronica once that she had known him when he was"
"younger, but day had followed day, and each had largely obliterated the"
"impression of its predecessor. But she certainly remembered that when"
"she was a little girl he sometimes wore tennis flannels, and also rode a"
"bicycle very dexterously in through the gates to the front door. And"
"in those days, too, he used to help her mother with her gardening, and"
"hover about her while she stood on the ladder and hammered creepers to"
"the scullery wall."
"It had been Ann Veronica's lot as the youngest child to live in a home"
"that became less animated and various as she grew up. Her mother had"
"died when she was thirteen, her two much older sisters had married"
"off--one submissively, one insubordinately; her two brothers had gone"
"out into the world well ahead of her, and so she had made what she could"
"of her father. But he was not a father one could make much of."
"His ideas about girls and women were of a sentimental and modest"
"quality; they were creatures, he thought, either too bad for a modern"
"vocabulary, and then frequently most undesirably desirable, or too pure"
"and good for life. He made this simple classification of a large and"
"various sex to the exclusion of all intermediate kinds; he held that"
"the two classes had to be kept apart even in thought and remote from one"
"another. Women are made like the potter's vessels--either for worship"
"or contumely, and are withal fragile vessels. He had never wanted"
"daughters. Each time a daughter had been born to him he had concealed"
"his chagrin with great tenderness and effusion from his wife, and had"
"sworn unwontedly and with passionate sincerity in the bathroom. He was"
"a manly man, free from any strong maternal strain, and he had loved his"
"dark-eyed, dainty bright-colored, and active little wife with a real"
"vein of passion in his sentiment. But he had always felt (he had never"
"allowed himself to think of it) that the promptitude of their family"
"was a little indelicate of her, and in a sense an intrusion. He had,"
"however, planned brilliant careers for his two sons, and, with a certain"
"human amount of warping and delay, they were pursuing these. One was"
"in the Indian Civil Service and one in the rapidly developing motor"
"business. The daughters, he had hoped, would be their mother's care."
"He had no ideas about daughters. They happen to a man."
"Of course a little daughter is a delightful thing enough. It runs about"
"gayly, it romps, it is bright and pretty, it has enormous quantities of"
"soft hair and more power of expressing affection than its brothers. It"
"is a lovely little appendage to the mother who smiles over it, and it"
"does things quaintly like her, gestures with her very gestures. It makes"
"wonderful sentences that you can repeat in the City and are good"
"enough for Punch. You call it a lot of nicknames--\"Babs\" and \"Bibs\" and"
"\"Viddles\" and \"Vee\"; you whack at it playfully, and it whacks you back."
"It loves to sit on your knee. All that is jolly and as it should be."
"But a little daughter is one thing and a daughter quite another. There"
"one comes to a relationship that Mr. Stanley had never thought out."
"When he found himself thinking about it, it upset him so that he at once"
"resorted to distraction. The chromatic fiction with which he relieved"
"his mind glanced but slightly at this aspect of life, and never with any"
"quality of guidance. Its heroes never had daughters, they borrowed other"
"people's. The one fault, indeed, of this school of fiction for him was"
"that it had rather a light way with parental rights. His instinct was in"
"the direction of considering his daughters his absolute property, bound"
"to obey him, his to give away or his to keep to be a comfort in his"
"declining years just as he thought fit. About this conception of"
"ownership he perceived and desired a certain sentimental glamour, he"
"liked everything properly dressed, but it remained ownership. Ownership"
"seemed only a reasonable return for the cares and expenses of a"
"daughter's upbringing. Daughters were not like sons. He perceived,"
"however, that both the novels he read and the world he lived in"
"discountenanced these assumptions. Nothing else was put in their place,"
"and they remained sotto voce, as it were, in his mind. The new and"
"the old cancelled out; his daughters became quasi-independent"
"dependents--which is absurd. One married as he wished and one against"
"his wishes, and now here was Ann Veronica, his little Vee, discontented"
"with her beautiful, safe, and sheltering home, going about with hatless"
"friends to Socialist meetings and art-class dances, and displaying a"
"disposition to carry her scientific ambitions to unwomanly lengths. She"
"seemed to think he was merely the paymaster, handing over the means"
"of her freedom. And now she insisted that she MUST leave the chastened"
"security of the Tredgold Women's College for Russell's unbridled"
"classes, and wanted to go to fancy dress dances in pirate costume and"
"spend the residue of the night with Widgett's ramshackle girls in some"
"indescribable hotel in Soho!"
"He had done his best not to think about her at all, but the situation"
"and his sister had become altogether too urgent. He had finally put"
"aside The Lilac Sunbonnet, gone into his study, lit the gas fire, and"
"written the letter that had brought these unsatisfactory relations to a"
"head."
"Part 4"
"MY DEAR VEE, he wrote."
"These daughters! He gnawed his pen and reflected, tore the sheet up, and"
"began again."
"\"MY DEAR VERONICA,--Your aunt tells me you have involved yourself in"
"some arrangement with the Widgett girls about a Fancy Dress Ball in"
"London. I gather you wish to go up in some fantastic get-up, wrapped"
"about in your opera cloak, and that after the festivities you propose to"
"stay with these friends of yours, and without any older people in your"
"party, at an hotel. Now I am sorry to cross you in anything you have set"
"your heart upon, but I regret to say--\""
"\"H'm,\" he reflected, and crossed out the last four words."
"\"--but this cannot be.\""
"\"No,\" he said, and tried again: \"but I must tell you quite definitely"
"that I feel it to be my duty to forbid any such exploit.\""
"\"Damn!\" he remarked at the defaced letter; and, taking a fresh sheet, he"
"recopied what he had written. A certain irritation crept into his manner"
"as he did so."
"\"I regret that you should ever have proposed it,\" he went on."
"He meditated, and began a new paragraph."
"\"The fact of it is, and this absurd project of yours only brings it to"
"a head, you have begun to get hold of some very queer ideas about what a"
"young lady in your position may or may not venture to do. I do not think"
"you quite understand my ideals or what is becoming as between father and"
"daughter. Your attitude to me--\""
"He fell into a brown study. It was so difficult to put precisely."
"\"--and your aunt--\""
"For a time he searched for the mot juste. Then he went on:"
"\"--and, indeed, to most of the established things in life is, frankly,"
"unsatisfactory. You are restless, aggressive, critical with all"
"the crude unthinking criticism of youth. You have no grasp upon the"
"essential facts of life (I pray God you never may), and in your rash"
"ignorance you are prepared to dash into positions that may end in"
"lifelong regret. The life of a young girl is set about with prowling"
"pitfalls.\""
"He was arrested for a moment by an indistinct picture of Veronica"
"reading this last sentence. But he was now too deeply moved to trace"
"a certain unsatisfactoriness to its source in a mixture of metaphors."
"\"Well,\" he said, argumentatively, \"it IS. That's all about it. It's time"
"she knew.\""
"\"The life of a young girl is set about with prowling pitfalls, from"
"which she must be shielded at all costs.\""
"His lips tightened, and he frowned with solemn resolution."
"\"So long as I am your father, so long as your life is entrusted to my"
"care, I feel bound by every obligation to use my authority to check this"
"odd disposition of yours toward extravagant enterprises. A day will come"
"when you will thank me. It is not, my dear Veronica, that I think there"
"is any harm in you; there is not. But a girl is soiled not only by evil"
"but by the proximity of evil, and a reputation for rashness may do"
"her as serious an injury as really reprehensible conduct. So do please"
"believe that in this matter I am acting for the best.\""
"He signed his name and reflected. Then he opened the study door and"
"called \"Mollie!\" and returned to assume an attitude of authority on the"
"hearthrug, before the blue flames and orange glow of the gas fire."
"His sister appeared."
"She was dressed in one of those complicated dresses that are all lace"
"and work and confused patternings of black and purple and cream about"
"the body, and she was in many ways a younger feminine version of the"
"same theme as himself. She had the same sharp nose--which, indeed, only"
"Ann Veronica, of all the family, had escaped. She carried herself well,"
"whereas her brother slouched, and there was a certain aristocratic"
"dignity about her that she had acquired through her long engagement to"
"a curate of family, a scion of the Wiltshire Edmondshaws. He had died"
"before they married, and when her brother became a widower she had"
"come to his assistance and taken over much of the care of his youngest"
"daughter. But from the first her rather old-fashioned conception of life"
"had jarred with the suburban atmosphere, the High School spirit and the"
"memories of the light and little Mrs. Stanley, whose family had been by"
"any reckoning inconsiderable--to use the kindliest term. Miss Stanley"
"had determined from the outset to have the warmest affection for her"
"youngest niece and to be a second mother in her life--a second and a"
"better one; but she had found much to battle with, and there was much in"
"herself that Ann Veronica failed to understand. She came in now with an"
"air of reserved solicitude."
"Mr. Stanley pointed to the letter with a pipe he had drawn from his"
"jacket pocket. \"What do you think of that?\" he asked."
"She took it up in her many-ringed hands and read it judicially. He"
"filled his pipe slowly."
"\"Yes,\" she said at last, \"it is firm and affectionate.\""
"\"I could have said more.\""
"\"You seem to have said just what had to be said. It seems to me exactly"
"what is wanted. She really must not go to that affair.\""
"She paused, and he waited for her to speak."
"\"I don't think she quite sees the harm of those people or the sort of"
"life to which they would draw her,\" she said. \"They would spoil every"
"chance.\""
"\"She has chances?\" he said, helping her out."
"\"She is an extremely attractive girl,\" she said; and added, \"to some"
"people. Of course, one doesn't like to talk about things until there are"
"things to talk about.\""
"\"All the more reason why she shouldn't get herself talked about.\""
"\"That is exactly what I feel.\""
"Mr. Stanley took the letter and stood with it in his hand thoughtfully"
"for a time. \"I'd give anything,\" he remarked, \"to see our little Vee"
"happily and comfortably married.\""
"He gave the note to the parlormaid the next morning in an inadvertent,"
"casual manner just as he was leaving the house to catch his London"
"train. When Ann Veronica got it she had at first a wild, fantastic idea"
"that it contained a tip."
"Part 5"
"Ann Veronica's resolve to have things out with her father was not"
"accomplished without difficulty."
"He was not due from the City until about six, and so she went and played"
"Badminton with the Widgett girls until dinner-time. The atmosphere at"
"dinner was not propitious. Her aunt was blandly amiable above a certain"
"tremulous undertow, and talked as if to a caller about the alarming"
"spread of marigolds that summer at the end of the garden, a sort of"
"Yellow Peril to all the smaller hardy annuals, while her father brought"
"some papers to table and presented himself as preoccupied with them. \"It"
"really seems as if we shall have to put down marigolds altogether next"
"year,\" Aunt Molly repeated three times, \"and do away with marguerites."
"They seed beyond all reason.\" Elizabeth, the parlormaid, kept coming in"
"to hand vegetables whenever there seemed a chance of Ann Veronica asking"
"for an interview. Directly dinner was over Mr. Stanley, having pretended"
"to linger to smoke, fled suddenly up-stairs to petrography, and when"
"Veronica tapped he answered through the locked door, \"Go away, Vee! I'm"
"busy,\" and made a lapidary's wheel buzz loudly."
"Breakfast, too, was an impossible occasion. He read the Times with an"
"unusually passionate intentness, and then declared suddenly for the"
"earlier of the two trains he used."
"\"I'll come to the station,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I may as well come up by"
"this train.\""
"\"I may have to run,\" said her father, with an appeal to his watch."
"\"I'll run, too,\" she volunteered."
"Instead of which they walked sharply...."
"\"I say, daddy,\" she began, and was suddenly short of breath."
"\"If it's about that dance project,\" he said, \"it's no good, Veronica."
"I've made up my mind.\""
"\"You'll make me look a fool before all my friends.\""
"\"You shouldn't have made an engagement until you'd consulted your aunt.\""
"\"I thought I was old enough,\" she gasped, between laughter and crying."
"Her father's step quickened to a trot. \"I won't have you quarrelling and"
"crying in the Avenue,\" he said. \"Stop it!... If you've got anything"
"to say, you must say it to your aunt--\""
"\"But look here, daddy!\""
"He flapped the Times at her with an imperious gesture."
"\"It's settled. You're not to go. You're NOT to go.\""
"\"But it's about other things.\""
"\"I don't care. This isn't the place.\""
"\"Then may I come to the study to-night--after dinner?\""
"\"I'm--BUSY!\""
"\"It's important. If I can't talk anywhere else--I DO want an"
"understanding.\""
"Ahead of them walked a gentleman whom it was evident they must at their"
"present pace very speedily overtake. It was Ramage, the occupant of the"
"big house at the end of the Avenue. He had recently made Mr. Stanley's"
"acquaintance in the train and shown him one or two trifling civilities."
"He was an outside broker and the proprietor of a financial newspaper; he"
"had come up very rapidly in the last few years, and Mr. Stanley admired"
"and detested him in almost equal measure. It was intolerable to think"
"that he might overhear words and phrases. Mr. Stanley's pace slackened."
"\"You've no right to badger me like this, Veronica,\" he said. \"I can't"
"see what possible benefit can come of discussing things that are"
"settled. If you want advice, your aunt is the person. However, if you"
"must air your opinions--\""
"\"To-night, then, daddy!\""
"He made an angry but conceivably an assenting noise, and then Ramage"
"glanced back and stopped, saluted elaborately, and waited for them to"
"come up. He was a square-faced man of nearly fifty, with iron-gray hair"
"a mobile, clean-shaven mouth and rather protuberant black eyes that now"
"scrutinized Ann Veronica. He dressed rather after the fashion of the"
"West End than the City, and affected a cultured urbanity that somehow"
"disconcerted and always annoyed Ann Veronica's father extremely. He"
"did not play golf, but took his exercise on horseback, which was also"
"unsympathetic."
"\"Stuffy these trees make the Avenue,\" said Mr. Stanley as they drew"
"alongside, to account for his own ruffled and heated expression. \"They"
"ought to have been lopped in the spring.\""
"\"There's plenty of time,\" said Ramage. \"Is Miss Stanley coming up with"
"us?\""
"\"I go second,\" she said, \"and change at Wimbledon.\""
"\"We'll all go second,\" said Ramage, \"if we may?\""
"Mr. Stanley wanted to object strongly, but as he could not immediately"
"think how to put it, he contented himself with a grunt, and the motion"
"was carried. \"How's Mrs. Ramage?\" he asked."
"\"Very much as usual,\" said Ramage. \"She finds lying up so much very"
"irksome. But, you see, she HAS to lie up.\""
"The topic of his invalid wife bored him, and he turned at once to Ann"
"Veronica. \"And where are YOU going?\" he said. \"Are you going on again"
"this winter with that scientific work of yours? It's an instance of"
"heredity, I suppose.\" For a moment Mr. Stanley almost liked Ramage."
"\"You're a biologist, aren't you?\""
"He began to talk of his own impressions of biology as a commonplace"
"magazine reader who had to get what he could from the monthly reviews,"
"and was glad to meet with any information from nearer the fountainhead."
"In a little while he and she were talking quite easily and agreeably."
"They went on talking in the train--it seemed to her father a slight want"
"of deference to him--and he listened and pretended to read the Times. He"
"was struck disagreeably by Ramage's air of gallant consideration and Ann"
"Veronica's self-possessed answers. These things did not harmonize with"
"his conception of the forthcoming (if unavoidable) interview. After"
"all, it came to him suddenly as a harsh discovery that she might be in"
"a sense regarded as grownup. He was a man who in all things classified"
"without nuance, and for him there were in the matter of age just two"
"feminine classes and no more--girls and women. The distinction lay"
"chiefly in the right to pat their heads. But here was a girl--she must"
"be a girl, since she was his daughter and pat-able--imitating the"
"woman quite remarkably and cleverly. He resumed his listening. She was"
"discussing one of those modern advanced plays with a remarkable, with an"
"extraordinary, confidence."
"\"His love-making,\" she remarked, \"struck me as unconvincing. He seemed"
"too noisy.\""
"The full significance of her words did not instantly appear to him. Then"
"it dawned. Good heavens! She was discussing love-making. For a time he"
"heard no more, and stared with stony eyes at a Book-War proclamation in"
"leaded type that filled half a column of the Times that day. Could she"
"understand what she was talking about? Luckily it was a second-class"
"carriage and the ordinary fellow-travellers were not there. Everybody,"
"he felt, must be listening behind their papers."
"Of course, girls repeat phrases and opinions of which they cannot"
"possibly understand the meaning. But a middle-aged man like Ramage ought"
"to know better than to draw out a girl, the daughter of a friend and"
"neighbor...."
"Well, after all, he seemed to be turning the subject. \"Broddick is a"
"heavy man,\" he was saying, \"and the main interest of the play was the"
"embezzlement.\" Thank Heaven! Mr. Stanley allowed his paper to drop"
"a little, and scrutinized the hats and brows of their three"
"fellow-travellers."
"They reached Wimbledon, and Ramage whipped out to hand Miss Stanley"
"to the platform as though she had been a duchess, and she descended as"
"though such attentions from middle-aged, but still gallant, merchants"
"were a matter of course. Then, as Ramage readjusted himself in a corner,"
"he remarked: \"These young people shoot up, Stanley. It seems only"
"yesterday that she was running down the Avenue, all hair and legs.\""
"Mr. Stanley regarded him through his glasses with something approaching"
"animosity."
"\"Now she's all hat and ideas,\" he said, with an air of humor."
"\"She seems an unusually clever girl,\" said Ramage."
"Mr. Stanley regarded his neighbor's clean-shaven face almost warily."
"\"I'm not sure whether we don't rather overdo all this higher education,\""
"he said, with an effect of conveying profound meanings."
"Part 6"
"He became quite sure, by a sort of accumulation of reflection, as the"
"day wore on. He found his youngest daughter intrusive in his thoughts"
"all through the morning, and still more so in the afternoon. He saw her"
"young and graceful back as she descended from the carriage, severely"
"ignoring him, and recalled a glimpse he had of her face, bright and"
"serene, as his train ran out of Wimbledon. He recalled with exasperating"
"perplexity her clear, matter-of-fact tone as she talked about"
"love-making being unconvincing. He was really very proud of her, and"
"extraordinarily angry and resentful at the innocent and audacious"
"self-reliance that seemed to intimate her sense of absolute independence"
"of him, her absolute security without him. After all, she only LOOKED a"
"woman. She was rash and ignorant, absolutely inexperienced. Absolutely."
"He began to think of speeches, very firm, explicit speeches, he would"
"make."
"He lunched in the Legal Club in Chancery Lane, and met Ogilvy. Daughters"
"were in the air that day. Ogilvy was full of a client's trouble in"
"that matter, a grave and even tragic trouble. He told some of the"
"particulars."
"\"Curious case,\" said Ogilvy, buttering his bread and cutting it up in a"
"way he had. \"Curious case--and sets one thinking.\""
"He resumed, after a mouthful: \"Here is a girl of sixteen or seventeen,"
"seventeen and a half to be exact, running about, as one might say, in"
"London. Schoolgirl. Her family are solid West End people, Kensington"
"people. Father--dead. She goes out and comes home. Afterward goes on to"
"Oxford. Twenty-one, twenty-two. Why doesn't she marry? Plenty of money"
"under her father's will. Charming girl.\""
"He consumed Irish stew for some moments."
"\"Married already,\" he said, with his mouth full. \"Shopman.\""
"\"Good God!\" said Mr. Stanley."
"\"Good-looking rascal she met at Worthing. Very romantic and all that. He"
"fixed it.\""
"\"But--\""
"\"He left her alone. Pure romantic nonsense on her part. Sheer"
"calculation on his. Went up to Somerset House to examine the will before"
"he did it. Yes. Nice position.\""
"\"She doesn't care for him now?\""
"\"Not a bit. What a girl of sixteen cares for is hair and a high color"
"and moonlight and a tenor voice. I suppose most of our daughters would"
"marry organ-grinders if they had a chance--at that age. My son wanted"
"to marry a woman of thirty in a tobacconist's shop. Only a son's another"
"story. We fixed that. Well, that's the situation. My people don't know"
"what to do. Can't face a scandal. Can't ask the gent to go abroad and"
"condone a bigamy. He misstated her age and address; but you can't get"
"home on him for a thing like that.... There you are! Girl spoilt for"
"life. Makes one want to go back to the Oriental system!\""
"Mr. Stanley poured wine. \"Damned Rascal!\" he said. \"Isn't there a"
"brother to kick him?\""
"\"Mere satisfaction,\" reflected Ogilvy. \"Mere sensuality. I rather think"
"they have kicked him, from the tone of some of the letters. Nice, of"
"course. But it doesn't alter the situation.\""
"\"It's these Rascals,\" said Mr. Stanley, and paused."
"\"Always has been,\" said Ogilvy. \"Our interest lies in heading them off.\""
"\"There was a time when girls didn't get these extravagant ideas.\""
"\"Lydia Languish, for example. Anyhow, they didn't run about so much.\""
"\"Yes. That's about the beginning. It's these damned novels. All this"
"torrent of misleading, spurious stuff that pours from the press. These"
"sham ideals and advanced notions. Women who Dids, and all that kind of"
"thing....\""
"Ogilvy reflected. \"This girl--she's really a very charming, frank"
"person--had had her imagination fired, so she told me, by a school"
"performance of Romeo and Juliet.\""
"Mr. Stanley decided to treat that as irrelevant. \"There ought to be a"
"Censorship of Books. We want it badly at the present time. Even WITH"
"the Censorship of Plays there's hardly a decent thing to which a man can"
"take his wife and daughters, a creeping taint of suggestion everywhere."
"What would it be without that safeguard?\""
"Ogilvy pursued his own topic. \"I'm inclined to think, Stanley, myself"
"that as a matter of fact it was the expurgated Romeo and Juliet did the"
"mischief. If our young person hadn't had the nurse part cut out, eh? She"
"might have known more and done less. I was curious about that. All they"
"left it was the moon and stars. And the balcony and 'My Romeo!'\""
"\"Shakespeare is altogether different from the modern stuff. Altogether"
"different. I'm not discussing Shakespeare. I don't want to Bowdlerize"
"Shakespeare. I'm not that sort I quite agree. But this modern miasma--\""
"Mr. Stanley took mustard savagely."
"\"Well, we won't go into Shakespeare,\" said Ogilvy \"What interests me"
"is that our young women nowadays are running about as free as air"
"practically, with registry offices and all sorts of accommodation round"
"the corner. Nothing to check their proceedings but a declining habit of"
"telling the truth and the limitations of their imaginations. And in that"
"respect they stir up one another. Not my affair, of course, but I think"
"we ought to teach them more or restrain them more. One or the other."
"They're too free for their innocence or too innocent for their freedom."
"That's my point. Are you going to have any apple-tart, Stanley? The"
"apple-tart's been very good lately--very good!\""
"Part 7"
"At the end of dinner that evening Ann Veronica began: \"Father!\""
"Her father looked at her over his glasses and spoke with grave"
"deliberation; \"If there is anything you want to say to me,\" he said,"
"\"you must say it in the study. I am going to smoke a little here, and"
"then I shall go to the study. I don't see what you can have to say. I"
"should have thought my note cleared up everything. There are some papers"
"I have to look through to-night--important papers.\""
"\"I won't keep you very long, daddy,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"I don't see, Mollie,\" he remarked, taking a cigar from the box on"
"the table as his sister and daughter rose, \"why you and Vee shouldn't"
"discuss this little affair--whatever it is--without bothering me.\""
"It was the first time this controversy had become triangular, for all"
"three of them were shy by habit."
"He stopped in mid-sentence, and Ann Veronica opened the door for her"
"aunt. The air was thick with feelings. Her aunt went out of the room"
"with dignity and a rustle, and up-stairs to the fastness of her own"
"room. She agreed entirely with her brother. It distressed and confused"
"her that the girl should not come to her."
"It seemed to show a want of affection, to be a deliberate and unmerited"
"disregard, to justify the reprisal of being hurt."
"When Ann Veronica came into the study she found every evidence of a"
"carefully foreseen grouping about the gas fire. Both arm-chairs had been"
"moved a little so as to face each other on either side of the"
"fender, and in the circular glow of the green-shaded lamp there lay,"
"conspicuously waiting, a thick bundle of blue and white papers tied"
"with pink tape. Her father held some printed document in his hand,"
"and appeared not to observe her entry. \"Sit down,\" he said, and"
"perused--\"perused\" is the word for it--for some moments. Then he put"
"the paper by. \"And what is it all about, Veronica?\" he asked, with a"
"deliberate note of irony, looking at her a little quizzically over his"
"glasses."
"Ann Veronica looked bright and a little elated, and she disregarded"
"her father's invitation to be seated. She stood on the mat instead, and"
"looked down on him. \"Look here, daddy,\" she said, in a tone of great"
"reasonableness, \"I MUST go to that dance, you know.\""
"Her father's irony deepened. \"Why?\" he asked, suavely."
"Her answer was not quite ready. \"Well, because I don't see any reason"
"why I shouldn't.\""
"\"You see I do.\""
"\"Why shouldn't I go?\""
"\"It isn't a suitable place; it isn't a suitable gathering.\""
"\"But, daddy, what do you know of the place and the gathering?\""
"\"And it's entirely out of order; it isn't right, it isn't correct;"
"it's impossible for you to stay in an hotel in London--the idea is"
"preposterous. I can't imagine what possessed you, Veronica.\""
"He put his head on one side, pulled down the corners of his mouth, and"
"looked at her over his glasses."
"\"But why is it preposterous?\" asked Ann Veronica, and fiddled with a"
"pipe on the mantel."
"\"Surely!\" he remarked, with an expression of worried appeal."
"\"You see, daddy, I don't think it IS preposterous. That's really what"
"I want to discuss. It comes to this--am I to be trusted to take care of"
"myself, or am I not?\""
"\"To judge from this proposal of yours, I should say not.\""
"\"I think I am.\""
"\"As long as you remain under my roof--\" he began, and paused."
"\"You are going to treat me as though I wasn't. Well, I don't think"
"that's fair.\""
"\"Your ideas of fairness--\" he remarked, and discontinued that sentence."
"\"My dear girl,\" he said, in a tone of patient reasonableness, \"you are a"
"mere child. You know nothing of life, nothing of its dangers, nothing of"
"its possibilities. You think everything is harmless and simple, and so"
"forth. It isn't. It isn't. That's where you go wrong. In some things,"
"in many things, you must trust to your elders, to those who know more of"
"life than you do. Your aunt and I have discussed all this matter. There"
"it is. You can't go.\""
"The conversation hung for a moment. Ann Veronica tried to keep hold of"
"a complicated situation and not lose her head. She had turned round"
"sideways, so as to look down into the fire."
"\"You see, father,\" she said, \"it isn't only this affair of the dance."
"I want to go to that because it's a new experience, because I think"
"it will be interesting and give me a view of things. You say I know"
"nothing. That's probably true. But how am I to know of things?\""
"\"Some things I hope you may never know,\" he said."
"\"I'm not so sure. I want to know--just as much as I can.\""
"\"Tut!\" he said, fuming, and put out his hand to the papers in the pink"
"tape."
"\"Well, I do. It's just that I want to say. I want to be a human being;"
"I want to learn about things and know about things, and not to be"
"protected as something too precious for life, cooped up in one narrow"
"little corner.\""
"\"Cooped up!\" he cried. \"Did I stand in the way of your going to college?"
"Have I ever prevented you going about at any reasonable hour? You've got"
"a bicycle!\""
"\"H'm!\" said Ann Veronica, and then went on \"I want to be taken"
"seriously. A girl--at my age--is grown-up. I want to go on with"
"my University work under proper conditions, now that I've done the"
"Intermediate. It isn't as though I haven't done well. I've never muffed"
"an exam yet. Roddy muffed two....\""
"Her father interrupted. \"Now look here, Veronica, let us be plain with"
"each other. You are not going to that infidel Russell's classes. You are"
"not going anywhere but to the Tredgold College. I've thought that out,"
"and you must make up your mind to it. All sorts of considerations come"
"in. While you live in my house you must follow my ideas. You are wrong"
"even about that man's scientific position and his standard of work."
"There are men in the Lowndean who laugh at him--simply laugh at him."
"And I have seen work by his pupils myself that struck me as being--well,"
"next door to shameful. There's stories, too, about his demonstrator,"
"Capes Something or other. The kind of man who isn't content with his"
"science, and writes articles in the monthly reviews. Anyhow, there it"
"is: YOU ARE NOT GOING THERE.\""
"The girl received this intimation in silence, but the face that looked"
"down upon the gas fire took an expression of obstinacy that brought out"
"a hitherto latent resemblance between parent and child. When she spoke,"
"her lips twitched."
"\"Then I suppose when I have graduated I am to come home?\""
"\"It seems the natural course--\""
"\"And do nothing?\""
"\"There are plenty of things a girl can find to do at home.\""
"\"Until some one takes pity on me and marries me?\""
"He raised his eyebrows in mild appeal. His foot tapped impatiently, and"
"he took up the papers."
"\"Look here, father,\" she said, with a change in her voice, \"suppose I"
"won't stand it?\""
"He regarded her as though this was a new idea."
"\"Suppose, for example, I go to this dance?\""
"\"You won't.\""
"\"Well\"--her breath failed her for a moment. \"How would you prevent it?\""
"she asked."
"\"But I have forbidden it!\" he said, raising his voice."
"\"Yes, I know. But suppose I go?\""
"\"Now, Veronica! No, no. This won't do. Understand me! I forbid it. I"
"do not want to hear from you even the threat of disobedience.\" He spoke"
"loudly. \"The thing is forbidden!\""
"\"I am ready to give up anything that you show to be wrong.\""
"\"You will give up anything I wish you to give up.\""
"They stared at each other through a pause, and both faces were flushed"
"and obstinate."
"She was trying by some wonderful, secret, and motionless gymnastics to"
"restrain her tears. But when she spoke her lips quivered, and they"
"came. \"I mean to go to that dance!\" she blubbered. \"I mean to go to"
"that dance! I meant to reason with you, but you won't reason. You're"
"dogmatic.\""
"At the sight of her tears his expression changed to a mingling of"
"triumph and concern. He stood up, apparently intending to put an"
"arm about her, but she stepped back from him quickly. She produced a"
"handkerchief, and with one sweep of this and a simultaneous gulp had"
"abolished her fit of weeping. His voice now had lost its ironies."
"\"Now, Veronica,\" he pleaded, \"Veronica, this is most unreasonable. All"
"we do is for your good. Neither your aunt nor I have any other thought"
"but what is best for you.\""
"\"Only you won't let me live. Only you won't let me exist!\""
"Mr. Stanley lost patience. He bullied frankly."
"\"What nonsense is this? What raving! My dear child, you DO live, you"
"DO exist! You have this home. You have friends, acquaintances, social"
"standing, brothers and sisters, every advantage! Instead of which, you"
"want to go to some mixed classes or other and cut up rabbits and dance"
"about at nights in wild costumes with casual art student friends and God"
"knows who. That--that isn't living! You are beside yourself. You don't"
"know what you ask nor what you say. You have neither reason nor logic."
"I am sorry to seem to hurt you, but all I say is for your good. You"
"MUST not, you SHALL not go. On this I am resolved. I put my foot down"
"like--like adamant. And a time will come, Veronica, mark my words, a"
"time will come when you will bless me for my firmness to-night. It goes"
"to my heart to disappoint you, but this thing must not be.\""
"He sidled toward her, but she recoiled from him, leaving him in"
"possession of the hearth-rug."
"\"Well,\" she said, \"good-night, father.\""
"\"What!\" he asked; \"not a kiss?\""
"She affected not to hear."
"The door closed softly upon her. For a long time he remained standing"
"before the fire, staring at the situation. Then he sat down and filled"
"his pipe slowly and thoughtfully...."
"\"I don't see what else I could have said,\" he remarked."
"CHAPTER THE SECOND"
"ANN VERONICA GATHERS POINTS OF VIEW"
"Part 1"
"\"Are you coming to the Fadden Dance, Ann Veronica?\" asked Constance"
"Widgett."
"Ann Veronica considered her answer. \"I mean to,\" she replied."
"\"You are making your dress?\""
"\"Such as it is.\""
"They were in the elder Widgett girl's bedroom; Hetty was laid up, she"
"said, with a sprained ankle, and a miscellaneous party was gossiping"
"away her tedium. It was a large, littered, self-forgetful apartment,"
"decorated with unframed charcoal sketches by various incipient masters;"
"and an open bookcase, surmounted by plaster casts and the half of a"
"human skull, displayed an odd miscellany of books--Shaw and Swinburne,"
"Tom Jones, Fabian Essays, Pope and Dumas, cheek by jowl. Constance"
"Widgett's abundant copper-red hair was bent down over some dimly"
"remunerative work--stencilling in colors upon rough, white material--at"
"a kitchen table she had dragged up-stairs for the purpose, while on her"
"bed there was seated a slender lady of thirty or so in a dingy green"
"dress, whom Constance had introduced with a wave of her hand as Miss"
"Miniver. Miss Miniver looked out on the world through large emotional"
"blue eyes that were further magnified by the glasses she wore, and her"
"nose was pinched and pink, and her mouth was whimsically petulant. Her"
"glasses moved quickly as her glance travelled from face to face."
"She seemed bursting with the desire to talk, and watching for her"
"opportunity. On her lapel was an ivory button, bearing the words \"Votes"
"for Women.\" Ann Veronica sat at the foot of the sufferer's bed, while"
"Teddy Widgett, being something of an athlete, occupied the only"
"bed-room chair--a decadent piece, essentially a tripod and largely a"
"formality--and smoked cigarettes, and tried to conceal the fact that"
"he was looking all the time at Ann Veronica's eyebrows. Teddy was the"
"hatless young man who had turned Ann Veronica aside from the Avenue two"
"days before. He was the junior of both his sisters, co-educated and"
"much broken in to feminine society. A bowl of roses, just brought by"
"Ann Veronica, adorned the communal dressing-table, and Ann Veronica was"
"particularly trim in preparation for a call she was to make with her"
"aunt later in the afternoon."
"Ann Veronica decided to be more explicit. \"I've been,\" she said,"
"\"forbidden to come.\""
"\"Hul-LO!\" said Hetty, turning her head on the pillow; and Teddy remarked"
"with profound emotion, \"My God!\""
"\"Yes,\" said Ann Veronica, \"and that complicates the situation.\""
"\"Auntie?\" asked Constance, who was conversant with Ann Veronica's"
"affairs."
"\"No! My father. It's--it's a serious prohibition.\""
"\"Why?\" asked Hetty."
"\"That's the point. I asked him why, and he hadn't a reason.\""
"\"YOU ASKED YOUR FATHER FOR A REASON!\" said Miss Miniver, with great"
"intensity."
"\"Yes. I tried to have it out with him, but he wouldn't have it out.\" Ann"
"Veronica reflected for an instant \"That's why I think I ought to come.\""
"\"You asked your father for a reason!\" Miss Miniver repeated."
"\"We always have things out with OUR father, poor dear!\" said Hetty."
"\"He's got almost to like it.\""
"\"Men,\" said Miss Miniver, \"NEVER have a reason. Never! And they don't"
"know it! They have no idea of it. It's one of their worst traits, one of"
"their very worst.\""
"\"But I say, Vee,\" said Constance, \"if you come and you are forbidden to"
"come there'll be the deuce of a row.\""
"Ann Veronica was deciding for further confidences. Her situation"
"was perplexing her very much, and the Widgett atmosphere was lax and"
"sympathetic, and provocative of discussion. \"It isn't only the dance,\""
"she said."
"\"There's the classes,\" said Constance, the well-informed."
"\"There's the whole situation. Apparently I'm not to exist yet. I'm not"
"to study, I'm not to grow. I've got to stay at home and remain in a"
"state of suspended animation.\""
"\"DUSTING!\" said Miss Miniver, in a sepulchral voice."
"\"Until you marry, Vee,\" said Hetty."
"\"Well, I don't feel like standing it.\""
"\"Thousands of women have married merely for freedom,\" said Miss Miniver."
"\"Thousands! Ugh! And found it a worse slavery.\""
"\"I suppose,\" said Constance, stencilling away at bright pink petals,"
"\"it's our lot. But it's very beastly.\""
"\"What's our lot?\" asked her sister."
"\"Slavery! Downtroddenness! When I think of it I feel all over boot"
"marks--men's boots. We hide it bravely, but so it is. Damn! I've"
"splashed.\""
"Miss Miniver's manner became impressive. She addressed Ann Veronica"
"with an air of conveying great open secrets to her. \"As things are at"
"present,\" she said, \"it is true. We live under man-made institutions,"
"and that is what they amount to. Every girl in the world practically,"
"except a few of us who teach or type-write, and then we're underpaid and"
"sweated--it's dreadful to think how we are sweated!\" She had lost her"
"generalization, whatever it was. She hung for a moment, and then went"
"on, conclusively, \"Until we have the vote that is how things WILL be.\""
"\"I'm all for the vote,\" said Teddy."
"\"I suppose a girl MUST be underpaid and sweated,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I"
"suppose there's no way of getting a decent income--independently.\""
"\"Women have practically NO economic freedom,\" said Miss Miniver,"
"\"because they have no political freedom. Men have seen to that. The one"
"profession, the one decent profession, I mean, for a woman--except the"
"stage--is teaching, and there we trample on one another. Everywhere"
"else--the law, medicine, the Stock Exchange--prejudice bars us.\""
"\"There's art,\" said Ann Veronica, \"and writing.\""
"\"Every one hasn't the Gift. Even there a woman never gets a fair chance."
"Men are against her. Whatever she does is minimized. All the best"
"novels have been written by women, and yet see how men sneer at the lady"
"novelist still! There's only one way to get on for a woman, and that is"
"to please men. That is what they think we are for!\""
"\"We're beasts,\" said Teddy. \"Beasts!\""
"But Miss Miniver took no notice of his admission."
"\"Of course,\" said Miss Miniver--she went on in a regularly undulating"
"voice--\"we DO please men. We have that gift. We can see round them and"
"behind them and through them, and most of us use that knowledge, in the"
"silent way we have, for our great ends. Not all of us, but some of us."
"Too many. I wonder what men would say if we threw the mask aside--if"
"we really told them what WE thought of them, really showed them what WE"
"were.\" A flush of excitement crept into her cheeks."
"\"Maternity,\" she said, \"has been our undoing.\""
"From that she opened out into a long, confused emphatic discourse on the"
"position of women, full of wonderful statements, while Constance worked"
"at her stencilling and Ann Veronica and Hetty listened, and Teddy"
"contributed sympathetic noises and consumed cheap cigarettes. As she"
"talked she made weak little gestures with her hands, and she thrust her"
"face forward from her bent shoulders; and she peered sometimes at Ann"
"Veronica and sometimes at a photograph of the Axenstrasse, near"
"Fluelen, that hung upon the wall. Ann Veronica watched her face, vaguely"
"sympathizing with her, vaguely disliking her physical insufficiency and"
"her convulsive movements, and the fine eyebrows were knit with a faint"
"perplexity. Essentially the talk was a mixture of fragments of sentences"
"heard, of passages read, or arguments indicated rather than stated, and"
"all of it was served in a sauce of strange enthusiasm, thin yet"
"intense. Ann Veronica had had some training at the Tredgold College in"
"disentangling threads from confused statements, and she had a curious"
"persuasion that in all this fluent muddle there was something--something"
"real, something that signified. But it was very hard to follow. She did"
"not understand the note of hostility to men that ran through it all, the"
"bitter vindictiveness that lit Miss Miniver's cheeks and eyes, the"
"sense of some at last insupportable wrong slowly accumulated. She had no"
"inkling of that insupportable wrong."
"\"We are the species,\" said Miss Miniver, \"men are only incidents."
"They give themselves airs, but so it is. In all the species of animals"
"the females are more important than the males; the males have to please"
"them. Look at the cock's feathers, look at the competition there is"
"everywhere, except among humans. The stags and oxen and things all"
"have to fight for us, everywhere. Only in man is the male made the"
"most important. And that happens through our maternity; it's our very"
"importance that degrades us."
"\"While we were minding the children they stole our rights and liberties."
"The children made us slaves, and the men took advantage of it."
"It's--Mrs. Shalford says--the accidental conquering the essential."
"Originally in the first animals there were no males, none at all. It"
"has been proved. Then they appear among the lower things\"--she made"
"meticulous gestures to figure the scale of life; she seemed to be"
"holding up specimens, and peering through her glasses at them--\"among"
"crustaceans and things, just as little creatures, ever so inferior to"
"the females. Mere hangers on. Things you would laugh at. And among human"
"beings, too, women to begin with were the rulers and leaders; they owned"
"all the property, they invented all the arts."
"\"The primitive government was the Matriarchate. The Matriarchate! The"
"Lords of Creation just ran about and did what they were told.\""
"\"But is that really so?\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"It has been proved,\" said Miss Miniver, and added, \"by American"
"professors.\""
"\"But how did they prove it?\""
"\"By science,\" said Miss Miniver, and hurried on, putting out a"
"rhetorical hand that showed a slash of finger through its glove. \"And"
"now, look at us! See what we have become. Toys! Delicate trifles! A sex"
"of invalids. It is we who have become the parasites and toys.\""
"It was, Ann Veronica felt, at once absurd and extraordinarily right."
"Hetty, who had periods of lucid expression, put the thing for her"
"from her pillow. She charged boldly into the space of Miss Miniver's"
"rhetorical pause."
"\"It isn't quite that we're toys. Nobody toys with me. Nobody regards"
"Constance or Vee as a delicate trifle.\""
"Teddy made some confused noise, a thoracic street row; some remark was"
"assassinated by a rival in his throat and buried hastily under a cough."
"\"They'd better not,\" said Hetty. \"The point is we're not toys, toys"
"isn't the word; we're litter. We're handfuls. We're regarded as"
"inflammable litter that mustn't be left about. We are the species, and"
"maternity is our game; that's all right, but nobody wants that admitted"
"for fear we should all catch fire, and set about fulfilling the purpose"
"of our beings without waiting for further explanations. As if we didn't"
"know! The practical trouble is our ages. They used to marry us off at"
"seventeen, rush us into things before we had time to protest. They don't"
"now. Heaven knows why! They don't marry most of us off now until high up"
"in the twenties. And the age gets higher. We have to hang about in the"
"interval. There's a great gulf opened, and nobody's got any plans what"
"to do with us. So the world is choked with waste and waiting daughters."
"Hanging about! And they start thinking and asking questions, and begin"
"to be neither one thing nor the other. We're partly human beings and"
"partly females in suspense.\""
"Miss Miniver followed with an expression of perplexity, her mouth shaped"
"to futile expositions. The Widgett method of thought puzzled her weakly"
"rhetorical mind. \"There is no remedy, girls,\" she began, breathlessly,"
"\"except the Vote. Give us that--\""
"Ann Veronica came in with a certain disregard of Miss Miniver. \"That's"
"it,\" she said. \"They have no plans for us. They have no ideas what to do"
"with us.\""
"\"Except,\" said Constance, surveying her work with her head on one side,"
"\"to keep the matches from the litter.\""
"\"And they won't let us make plans for ourselves.\""
"\"We will,\" said Miss Miniver, refusing to be suppressed, \"if some of us"
"have to be killed to get it.\" And she pressed her lips together in white"
"resolution and nodded, and she was manifestly full of that same passion"
"for conflict and self-sacrifice that has given the world martyrs since"
"the beginning of things. \"I wish I could make every woman, every girl,"
"see this as clearly as I see it--just what the Vote means to us. Just"
"what it means....\""
"Part 2"
"As Ann Veronica went back along the Avenue to her aunt she became aware"
"of a light-footed pursuer running. Teddy overtook her, a little out of"
"breath, his innocent face flushed, his straw-colored hair disordered. He"
"was out of breath, and spoke in broken sentences."
"\"I say, Vee. Half a minute, Vee. It's like this: You want freedom. Look"
"here. You know--if you want freedom. Just an idea of mine. You know"
"how those Russian students do? In Russia. Just a formal marriage. Mere"
"formality. Liberates the girl from parental control. See? You marry me."
"Simply. No further responsibility whatever. Without hindrance--present"
"occupation. Why not? Quite willing. Get a license--just an idea of mine."
"Doesn't matter a bit to me. Do anything to please you, Vee. Anything."
"Not fit to be dust on your boots. Still--there you are!\""
"He paused."
"Ann Veronica's desire to laugh unrestrainedly was checked by the"
"tremendous earnestness of his expression. \"Awfully good of you, Teddy.\""
"she said."
"He nodded silently, too full for words."
"\"But I don't see,\" said Ann Veronica, \"just how it fits the present"
"situation.\""
"\"No! Well, I just suggested it. Threw it out. Of course, if at any"
"time--see reason--alter your opinion. Always at your service. No"
"offence, I hope. All right! I'm off. Due to play hockey. Jackson's."
"Horrid snorters! So long, Vee! Just suggested it. See? Nothing really."
"Passing thought.\""
"\"Teddy,\" said Ann Veronica, \"you're a dear!\""
"\"Oh, quite!\" said Teddy, convulsively, and lifted an imaginary hat and"
"left her."
"Part 3"
"The call Ann Veronica paid with her aunt that afternoon had at first"
"much the same relation to the Widgett conversation that a plaster statue"
"of Mr. Gladstone would have to a carelessly displayed interior on a"
"dissecting-room table. The Widgetts talked with a remarkable absence of"
"external coverings; the Palsworthys found all the meanings of life on"
"its surfaces. They seemed the most wrapped things in all Ann Veronica's"
"wrappered world. The Widgett mental furniture was perhaps worn and"
"shabby, but there it was before you, undisguised, fading visibly in an"
"almost pitiless sunlight. Lady Palsworthy was the widow of a knight"
"who had won his spurs in the wholesale coal trade, she was of good"
"seventeenth-century attorney blood, a county family, and distantly"
"related to Aunt Mollie's deceased curate. She was the social leader of"
"Morningside Park, and in her superficial and euphuistic way an extremely"
"kind and pleasant woman. With her lived a Mrs. Pramlay, a sister of"
"the Morningside Park doctor, and a very active and useful member of the"
"Committee of the Impoverished Gentlewomen's Aid Society. Both ladies"
"were on easy and friendly terms with all that was best in Morningside"
"Park society; they had an afternoon once a month that was quite well"
"attended, they sometimes gave musical evenings, they dined out and gave"
"a finish to people's dinners, they had a full-sized croquet lawn and"
"tennis beyond, and understood the art of bringing people together."
"And they never talked of anything at all, never discussed, never even"
"encouraged gossip. They were just nice."
"Ann Veronica found herself walking back down the Avenue that had just"
"been the scene of her first proposal beside her aunt, and speculating"
"for the first time in her life about that lady's mental attitudes. Her"
"prevailing effect was one of quiet and complete assurance, as though she"
"knew all about everything, and was only restrained by her instinctive"
"delicacy from telling what she knew. But the restraint exercised by her"
"instinctive delicacy was very great; over and above coarse or sexual"
"matters it covered religion and politics and any mention of money"
"matters or crime, and Ann Veronica found herself wondering whether these"
"exclusions represented, after all, anything more than suppressions. Was"
"there anything at all in those locked rooms of her aunt's mind? Were"
"they fully furnished and only a little dusty and cobwebby and in need of"
"an airing, or were they stark vacancy except, perhaps, for a cockroach"
"or so or the gnawing of a rat? What was the mental equivalent of a rat's"
"gnawing? The image was going astray. But what would her aunt think of"
"Teddy's recent off-hand suggestion of marriage? What would she think of"
"the Widgett conversation? Suppose she was to tell her aunt quietly"
"but firmly about the parasitic males of degraded crustacea. The girl"
"suppressed a chuckle that would have been inexplicable."
"There came a wild rush of anthropological lore into her brain, a flare"
"of indecorous humor. It was one of the secret troubles of her mind, this"
"grotesque twist her ideas would sometimes take, as though they rebelled"
"and rioted. After all, she found herself reflecting, behind her aunt's"
"complacent visage there was a past as lurid as any one's--not, of"
"course, her aunt's own personal past, which was apparently just that"
"curate and almost incredibly jejune, but an ancestral past with all"
"sorts of scandalous things in it: fire and slaughterings, exogamy,"
"marriage by capture, corroborees, cannibalism! Ancestresses with perhaps"
"dim anticipatory likenesses to her aunt, their hair less neatly done,"
"no doubt, their manners and gestures as yet undisciplined, but still"
"ancestresses in the direct line, must have danced through a brief and"
"stirring life in the woady buff. Was there no echo anywhere in Miss"
"Stanley's pacified brain? Those empty rooms, if they were empty, were"
"the equivalents of astoundingly decorated predecessors. Perhaps it was"
"just as well there was no inherited memory."
"Ann Veronica was by this time quite shocked at her own thoughts, and yet"
"they would go on with their freaks. Great vistas of history opened, and"
"she and her aunt were near reverting to the primitive and passionate and"
"entirely indecorous arboreal--were swinging from branches by the"
"arms, and really going on quite dreadfully--when their arrival at"
"the Palsworthys' happily checked this play of fancy, and brought Ann"
"Veronica back to the exigencies of the wrappered life again."
"Lady Palsworthy liked Ann Veronica because she was never awkward,"
"had steady eyes, and an almost invariable neatness and dignity in her"
"clothes. She seemed just as stiff and shy as a girl ought to be, Lady"
"Palsworthy thought, neither garrulous nor unready, and free from nearly"
"all the heavy aggressiveness, the overgrown, overblown quality, the"
"egotism and want of consideration of the typical modern girl. But then"
"Lady Palsworthy had never seen Ann Veronica running like the wind"
"at hockey. She had never seen her sitting on tables nor heard her"
"discussing theology, and had failed to observe that the graceful figure"
"was a natural one and not due to ably chosen stays. She took it for"
"granted Ann Veronica wore stays--mild stays, perhaps, but stays, and"
"thought no more of the matter. She had seen her really only at teas,"
"with the Stanley strain in her uppermost. There are so many girls"
"nowadays who are quite unpresentable at tea, with their untrimmed"
"laughs, their awful dispositions of their legs when they sit down, their"
"slangy disrespect; they no longer smoke, it is true, like the girls of"
"the eighties and nineties, nevertheless to a fine intelligence they have"
"the flavor of tobacco. They have no amenities, they scratch the"
"mellow surface of things almost as if they did it on purpose; and"
"Lady Palsworthy and Mrs. Pramlay lived for amenities and the mellowed"
"surfaces of things. Ann Veronica was one of the few young people--and"
"one must have young people just as one must have flowers--one could ask"
"to a little gathering without the risk of a painful discord. Then the"
"distant relationship to Miss Stanley gave them a slight but pleasant"
"sense of proprietorship in the girl. They had their little dreams about"
"her."
"Mrs. Pramlay received them in the pretty chintz drawing-room, which"
"opened by French windows on the trim garden, with its croquet lawn, its"
"tennis-net in the middle distance, and its remote rose alley lined"
"with smart dahlias and flaming sunflowers. Her eye met Miss Stanley's"
"understandingly, and she was if anything a trifle more affectionate in"
"her greeting to Ann Veronica. Then Ann Veronica passed on toward the"
"tea in the garden, which was dotted with the elite of Morningside Park"
"society, and there she was pounced upon by Lady Palsworthy and given tea"
"and led about. Across the lawn and hovering indecisively, Ann Veronica"
"saw and immediately affected not to see Mr. Manning, Lady Palsworthy's"
"nephew, a tall young man of seven-and-thirty with a handsome,"
"thoughtful, impassive face, a full black mustache, and a certain heavy"
"luxuriousness of gesture. The party resolved itself for Ann Veronica"
"into a game in which she manoeuvred unostentatiously and finally"
"unsuccessfully to avoid talking alone with this gentleman."
"Mr. Manning had shown on previous occasions that he found Ann Veronica"
"interesting and that he wished to interest her. He was a civil servant"
"of some standing, and after a previous conversation upon aesthetics of"
"a sententious, nebulous, and sympathetic character, he had sent her a"
"small volume, which he described as the fruits of his leisure and which"
"was as a matter of fact rather carefully finished verse. It dealt with"
"fine aspects of Mr. Manning's feelings, and as Ann Veronica's mind"
"was still largely engaged with fundamentals and found no pleasure in"
"metrical forms, she had not as yet cut its pages. So that as she saw him"
"she remarked to herself very faintly but definitely, \"Oh, golly!\" and"
"set up a campaign of avoidance that Mr. Manning at last broke down by"
"coming directly at her as she talked with the vicar's aunt about some of"
"the details of the alleged smell of the new church lamps. He did not so"
"much cut into this conversation as loom over it, for he was a tall, if"
"rather studiously stooping, man."
"The face that looked down upon Ann Veronica was full of amiable"
"intention. \"Splendid you are looking to-day, Miss Stanley,\" he said."
"\"How well and jolly you must be feeling.\""
"He beamed over the effect of this and shook hands with effusion, and"
"Lady Palsworthy suddenly appeared as his confederate and disentangled"
"the vicar's aunt."
"\"I love this warm end of summer more than words can tell,\" he said."
"\"I've tried to make words tell it. It's no good. Mild, you know, and"
"boon. You want music.\""
"Ann Veronica agreed, and tried to make the manner of her assent cover a"
"possible knowledge of a probable poem."
"\"Splendid it must be to be a composer. Glorious! The Pastoral."
"Beethoven; he's the best of them. Don't you think? Tum, tay, tum, tay.\""
"Ann Veronica did."
"\"What have you been doing since our last talk? Still cutting up"
"rabbits and probing into things? I've often thought of that talk of"
"ours--often.\""
"He did not appear to require any answer to his question."
"\"Often,\" he repeated, a little heavily."
"\"Beautiful these autumn flowers are,\" said Ann Veronica, in a wide,"
"uncomfortable pause."
"\"Do come and see the Michaelmas daisies at the end of the garden,\" said"
"Mr. Manning, \"they're a dream.\" And Ann Veronica found herself being"
"carried off to an isolation even remoter and more conspicuous than the"
"corner of the lawn, with the whole of the party aiding and abetting and"
"glancing at them. \"Damn!\" said Ann Veronica to herself, rousing herself"
"for a conflict."
"Mr. Manning told her he loved beauty, and extorted a similar admission"
"from her; he then expatiated upon his own love of beauty. He said that"
"for him beauty justified life, that he could not imagine a good action"
"that was not a beautiful one nor any beautiful thing that could be"
"altogether bad. Ann Veronica hazarded an opinion that as a matter of"
"history some very beautiful people had, to a quite considerable extent,"
"been bad, but Mr. Manning questioned whether when they were bad they"
"were really beautiful or when they were beautiful bad. Ann Veronica"
"found her attention wandering a little as he told her that he was not"
"ashamed to feel almost slavish in the presence of really beautiful"
"people, and then they came to the Michaelmas daisies. They were really"
"very fine and abundant, with a blaze of perennial sunflowers behind"
"them."
"\"They make me want to shout,\" said Mr. Manning, with a sweep of the arm."
"\"They're very good this year,\" said Ann Veronica, avoiding controversial"
"matter."
"\"Either I want to shout,\" said Mr. Manning, \"when I see beautiful"
"things, or else I want to weep.\" He paused and looked at her, and said,"
"with a sudden drop into a confidential undertone, \"Or else I want to"
"pray.\""
"\"When is Michaelmas Day?\" said Ann Veronica, a little abruptly."
"\"Heaven knows!\" said Mr. Manning; and added, \"the twenty-ninth.\""
"\"I thought it was earlier,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Wasn't Parliament to"
"reassemble?\""
"He put out his hand and leaned against a tree and crossed his legs."
"\"You're not interested in politics?\" he asked, almost with a note of"
"protest."
"\"Well, rather,\" said Ann Veronica. \"It seems--It's interesting.\""
"\"Do you think so? I find my interest in that sort of thing decline and"
"decline.\""
"\"I'm curious. Perhaps because I don't know. I suppose an intelligent"
"person OUGHT to be interested in political affairs. They concern us"
"all.\""
"\"I wonder,\" said Mr. Manning, with a baffling smile."
"\"I think they do. After all, they're history in the making.\""
"\"A sort of history,\" said Mr. Manning; and repeated, \"a sort of history."
"But look at these glorious daisies!\""
"\"But don't you think political questions ARE important?\""
"\"I don't think they are this afternoon, and I don't think they are to"
"you.\""
"Ann Veronica turned her back on the Michaelmas daisies, and faced toward"
"the house with an air of a duty completed."
"\"Just come to that seat now you are here, Miss Stanley, and look down"
"the other path; there's a vista of just the common sort. Better even"
"than these.\""
"Ann Veronica walked as he indicated."
"\"You know I'm old-fashioned, Miss Stanley. I don't think women need to"
"trouble about political questions.\""
"\"I want a vote,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"Really!\" said Mr. Manning, in an earnest voice, and waved his hand to"
"the alley of mauve and purple. \"I wish you didn't.\""
"\"Why not?\" She turned on him."
"\"It jars. It jars with all my ideas. Women to me are something so"
"serene, so fine, so feminine, and politics are so dusty, so sordid,"
"so wearisome and quarrelsome. It seems to me a woman's duty to be"
"beautiful, to BE beautiful and to behave beautifully, and politics"
"are by their very nature ugly. You see, I--I am a woman worshipper."
"I worshipped women long before I found any woman I might ever hope"
"to worship. Long ago. And--the idea of committees, of hustings, of"
"agenda-papers!\""
"\"I don't see why the responsibility of beauty should all be shifted on"
"to the women,\" said Ann Veronica, suddenly remembering a part of Miss"
"Miniver's discourse."
"\"It rests with them by the nature of things. Why should you who are"
"queens come down from your thrones? If you can afford it, WE can't. We"
"can't afford to turn our women, our Madonnas, our Saint Catherines, our"
"Mona Lisas, our goddesses and angels and fairy princesses, into a sort"
"of man. Womanhood is sacred to me. My politics in that matter wouldn't"
"be to give women votes. I'm a Socialist, Miss Stanley.\""
"\"WHAT?\" said Ann Veronica, startled."
"\"A Socialist of the order of John Ruskin. Indeed I am! I would make this"
"country a collective monarchy, and all the girls and women in it should"
"be the Queen. They should never come into contact with politics or"
"economics--or any of those things. And we men would work for them and"
"serve them in loyal fealty.\""
"\"That's rather the theory now,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Only so many men"
"neglect their duties.\""
"\"Yes,\" said Mr. Manning, with an air of emerging from an elaborate"
"demonstration, \"and so each of us must, under existing conditions, being"
"chivalrous indeed to all women, choose for himself his own particular"
"and worshipful queen.\""
"\"So far as one can judge from the system in practice,\" said Ann"
"Veronica, speaking in a loud, common-sense, detached tone, and beginning"
"to walk slowly but resolutely toward the lawn, \"it doesn't work.\""
"\"Every one must be experimental,\" said Mr. Manning, and glanced round"
"hastily for further horticultural points of interest in secluded"
"corners. None presented themselves to save him from that return."
"\"That's all very well when one isn't the material experimented upon,\""
"Ann Veronica had remarked."
"\"Women would--they DO have far more power than they think, as"
"influences, as inspirations.\""
"Ann Veronica said nothing in answer to that."
"\"You say you want a vote,\" said Mr. Manning, abruptly."
"\"I think I ought to have one.\""
"\"Well, I have two,\" said Mr. Manning--\"one in Oxford University and one"
"in Kensington.\" He caught up and went on with a sort of clumsiness: \"Let"
"me present you with them and be your voter.\""
"There followed an instant's pause, and then Ann Veronica had decided to"
"misunderstand."
"\"I want a vote for myself,\" she said. \"I don't see why I should take it"
"second-hand. Though it's very kind of you. And rather unscrupulous. Have"
"you ever voted, Mr. Manning? I suppose there's a sort of place like a"
"ticket-office. And a ballot-box--\" Her face assumed an expression of"
"intellectual conflict. \"What is a ballot-box like, exactly?\" she asked,"
"as though it was very important to her."
"Mr. Manning regarded her thoughtfully for a moment and stroked his"
"mustache. \"A ballot-box, you know,\" he said, \"is very largely just a"
"box.\" He made quite a long pause, and went on, with a sigh: \"You have a"
"voting paper given you--\""
"They emerged into the publicity of the lawn."
"\"Yes,\" said Ann Veronica, \"yes,\" to his explanation, and saw across"
"the lawn Lady Palsworthy talking to her aunt, and both of them staring"
"frankly across at her and Mr. Manning as they talked."
"CHAPTER THE THIRD"
"THE MORNING OF THE CRISIS"
"Part 1"
"Two days after came the day of the Crisis, the day of the Fadden Dance."
"It would have been a crisis anyhow, but it was complicated in Ann"
"Veronica's mind by the fact that a letter lay on the breakfast-table"
"from Mr. Manning, and that her aunt focussed a brightly tactful"
"disregard upon this throughout the meal. Ann Veronica had come down"
"thinking of nothing in the world but her inflexible resolution to go to"
"the dance in the teeth of all opposition. She did not know Mr. Manning's"
"handwriting, and opened his letter and read some lines before its import"
"appeared. Then for a time she forgot the Fadden affair altogether."
"With a well-simulated unconcern and a heightened color she finished her"
"breakfast."
"She was not obliged to go to the Tredgold College, because as yet the"
"College had not settled down for the session. She was supposed to be"
"reading at home, and after breakfast she strolled into the vegetable"
"garden, and having taken up a position upon the staging of a disused"
"greenhouse that had the double advantage of being hidden from the"
"windows of the house and secure from the sudden appearance of any one,"
"she resumed the reading of Mr. Manning's letter."
"Mr. Manning's handwriting had an air of being clear without being easily"
"legible; it was large and rather roundish, with a lack of definition"
"about the letters and a disposition to treat the large ones as"
"liberal-minded people nowadays treat opinions, as all amounting to the"
"same thing really--a years-smoothed boyish rather than an adult hand."
"And it filled seven sheets of notepaper, each written only on one side."
"\"MY DEAR MISS STANLEY,\" it began,--\"I hope you will forgive my"
"bothering you with a letter, but I have been thinking very much over our"
"conversation at Lady Palsworthy's, and I feel there are things I want"
"to say to you so much that I cannot wait until we meet again. It is the"
"worst of talk under such social circumstances that it is always getting"
"cut off so soon as it is beginning; and I went home that afternoon"
"feeling I had said nothing--literally nothing--of the things I had meant"
"to say to you and that were coursing through my head. They were things I"
"had meant very much to talk to you about, so that I went home vexed and"
"disappointed, and only relieved myself a little by writing a few verses."
"I wonder if you will mind very much when I tell you they were suggested"
"by you. You must forgive the poet's license I take. Here is one verse."
"The metrical irregularity is intentional, because I want, as it were, to"
"put you apart: to change the lilt and the mood altogether when I speak"
"of you."
"     \"'A SONG OF LADIES AND MY LADY"
"     \"'Saintly white and a lily is Mary,"
"     Margaret's violets, sweet and shy;"
"     Green and dewy is Nellie-bud fairy,"
"     Forget-me-nots live in Gwendolen's eye."
"     Annabel shines like a star in the darkness,"
"     Rosamund queens it a rose, deep rose;"
"     But the lady I love is like sunshine in April weather,"
"     She gleams and gladdens, she warms--and goes.'"
"\"Crude, I admit. But let that verse tell my secret. All bad"
"verse--originally the epigram was Lang's, I believe--is written in a"
"state of emotion."
"\"My dear Miss Stanley, when I talked to you the other afternoon of work"
"and politics and such-like things, my mind was all the time resenting it"
"beyond measure. There we were discussing whether you should have a vote,"
"and I remembered the last occasion we met it was about your prospects of"
"success in the medical profession or as a Government official such as a"
"number of women now are, and all the time my heart was crying out within"
"me, 'Here is the Queen of your career.' I wanted, as I have never wanted"
"before, to take you up, to make you mine, to carry you off and set you"
"apart from all the strain and turmoil of life. For nothing will ever"
"convince me that it is not the man's share in life to shield, to"
"protect, to lead and toil and watch and battle with the world at large."
"I want to be your knight, your servant, your protector, your--I dare"
"scarcely write the word--your husband. So I come suppliant. I am"
"five-and-thirty, and I have knocked about in the world and tasted the"
"quality of life. I had a hard fight to begin with to win my way into the"
"Upper Division--I was third on a list of forty-seven--and since then I"
"have found myself promoted almost yearly in a widening sphere of social"
"service. Before I met you I never met any one whom I felt I could"
"love, but you have discovered depths in my own nature I had scarcely"
"suspected. Except for a few early ebullitions of passion, natural to"
"a warm and romantic disposition, and leaving no harmful"
"after-effects--ebullitions that by the standards of the higher truth I"
"feel no one can justly cast a stone at, and of which I for one am by no"
"means ashamed--I come to you a pure and unencumbered man. I love you."
"In addition to my public salary I have a certain private property and"
"further expectations through my aunt, so that I can offer you a life"
"of wide and generous refinement, travel, books, discussion, and easy"
"relations with a circle of clever and brilliant and thoughtful people"
"with whom my literary work has brought me into contact, and of which,"
"seeing me only as you have done alone in Morningside Park, you can have"
"no idea. I have a certain standing not only as a singer but as a critic,"
"and I belong to one of the most brilliant causerie dinner clubs of"
"the day, in which successful Bohemianism, politicians, men of affairs,"
"artists, sculptors, and cultivated noblemen generally, mingle together"
"in the easiest and most delightful intercourse. That is my real milieu,"
"and one that I am convinced you would not only adorn but delight in."
"\"I find it very hard to write this letter. There are so many things"
"I want to tell you, and they stand on such different levels, that"
"the effect is necessarily confusing and discordant, and I find myself"
"doubting if I am really giving you the thread of emotion that should run"
"through all this letter. For although I must confess it reads very much"
"like an application or a testimonial or some such thing as that, I can"
"assure you I am writing this in fear and trembling with a sinking heart."
"My mind is full of ideas and images that I have been cherishing and"
"accumulating--dreams of travelling side by side, of lunching quietly"
"together in some jolly restaurant, of moonlight and music and all that"
"side of life, of seeing you dressed like a queen and shining in some"
"brilliant throng--mine; of your looking at flowers in some old-world"
"garden, our garden--there are splendid places to be got down in Surrey,"
"and a little runabout motor is quite within my means. You know they say,"
"as, indeed, I have just quoted already, that all bad poetry is written"
"in a state of emotion, but I have no doubt that this is true of bad"
"offers of marriage. I have often felt before that it is only when one"
"has nothing to say that one can write easy poetry. Witness Browning. And"
"how can I get into one brief letter the complex accumulated desires of"
"what is now, I find on reference to my diary, nearly sixteen months of"
"letting my mind run on you--ever since that jolly party at Surbiton,"
"where we raced and beat the other boat. You steered and I rowed stroke."
"My very sentences stumble and give way. But I do not even care if I am"
"absurd. I am a resolute man, and hitherto when I have wanted a thing I"
"have got it; but I have never yet wanted anything in my life as I have"
"wanted you. It isn't the same thing. I am afraid because I love you, so"
"that the mere thought of failure hurts. If I did not love you so much I"
"believe I could win you by sheer force of character, for people tell me"
"I am naturally of the dominating type. Most of my successes in life have"
"been made with a sort of reckless vigor."
"\"Well, I have said what I had to say, stumblingly and badly, and baldly."
"But I am sick of tearing up letters and hopeless of getting what I have"
"to say better said. It would be easy enough for me to write an eloquent"
"letter about something else. Only I do not care to write about anything"
"else. Let me put the main question to you now that I could not put the"
"other afternoon. Will you marry me, Ann Veronica?"
"\"Very sincerely yours,"
"\"HUBERT MANNING.\""
"Ann Veronica read this letter through with grave, attentive eyes."
"Her interest grew as she read, a certain distaste disappeared. Twice she"
"smiled, but not unkindly. Then she went back and mixed up the sheets in"
"a search for particular passages. Finally she fell into reflection."
"\"Odd!\" she said. \"I suppose I shall have to write an answer. It's so"
"different from what one has been led to expect.\""
"She became aware of her aunt, through the panes of the greenhouse,"
"advancing with an air of serene unconsciousness from among the raspberry"
"canes."
"\"No you don't!\" said Ann Veronica, and walked out at a brisk and"
"business-like pace toward the house."
"\"I'm going for a long tramp, auntie,\" she said."
"\"Alone, dear?\""
"\"Yes, aunt. I've got a lot of things to think about.\""
"Miss Stanley reflected as Ann Veronica went toward the house. She"
"thought her niece very hard and very self-possessed and self-confident."
"She ought to be softened and tender and confidential at this phase of"
"her life. She seemed to have no idea whatever of the emotional states"
"that were becoming to her age and position. Miss Stanley walked round"
"the garden thinking, and presently house and garden reverberated to Ann"
"Veronica's slamming of the front door."
"\"I wonder!\" said Miss Stanley."
"For a long time she surveyed a row of towering holly-hocks, as though"
"they offered an explanation. Then she went in and up-stairs, hesitated"
"on the landing, and finally, a little breathless and with an air of"
"great dignity, opened the door and walked into Ann Veronica's room. It"
"was a neat, efficient-looking room, with a writing-table placed with a"
"business-like regard to the window, and a bookcase surmounted by a"
"pig's skull, a dissected frog in a sealed bottle, and a pile of"
"shiny, black-covered note-books. In the corner of the room were two"
"hockey-sticks and a tennis-racket, and upon the walls Ann Veronica,"
"by means of autotypes, had indicated her proclivities in art. But Miss"
"Stanley took no notice of these things. She walked straight across to"
"the wardrobe and opened it. There, hanging among Ann Veronica's more"
"normal clothing, was a skimpy dress of red canvas, trimmed with cheap"
"and tawdry braid, and short--it could hardly reach below the knee. On"
"the same peg and evidently belonging to it was a black velvet Zouave"
"jacket. And then! a garment that was conceivably a secondary skirt."
"Miss Stanley hesitated, and took first one and then another of the"
"constituents of this costume off its peg and surveyed it."
"The third item she took with a trembling hand by its waistbelt. As she"
"raised it, its lower portion fell apart into two baggy crimson masses."
"\"TROUSERS!\" she whispered."
"Her eyes travelled about the room as if in appeal to the very chairs."
"Tucked under the writing-table a pair of yellow and gold Turkish"
"slippers of a highly meretricious quality caught her eye. She walked"
"over to them still carrying the trousers in her hands, and stooped to"
"examine them. They were ingenious disguises of gilt paper destructively"
"gummed, it would seem, to Ann Veronicas' best dancing-slippers."
"Then she reverted to the trousers."
"\"How CAN I tell him?\" whispered Miss Stanley."
"Part 2"
"Ann Veronica carried a light but business-like walking-stick. She walked"
"with an easy quickness down the Avenue and through the proletarian"
"portion of Morningside Park, and crossing these fields came into a"
"pretty overhung lane that led toward Caddington and the Downs. And"
"then her pace slackened. She tucked her stick under her arm and re-read"
"Manning's letter."
"\"Let me think,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I wish this hadn't turned up to-day"
"of all days.\""
"She found it difficult to begin thinking, and indeed she was anything"
"but clear what it was she had to think about. Practically it was most"
"of the chief interests in life that she proposed to settle in this"
"pedestrian meditation. Primarily it was her own problem, and in"
"particular the answer she had to give to Mr. Manning's letter, but in"
"order to get data for that she found that she, having a logical and"
"ordered mind, had to decide upon the general relations of men to women,"
"the objects and conditions of marriage and its bearing upon the"
"welfare of the race, the purpose of the race, the purpose, if any, of"
"everything...."
"\"Frightful lot of things aren't settled,\" said Ann Veronica. In"
"addition, the Fadden Dance business, all out of proportion, occupied"
"the whole foreground of her thoughts and threw a color of rebellion"
"over everything. She kept thinking she was thinking about Mr. Manning's"
"proposal of marriage and finding she was thinking of the dance."
"For a time her efforts to achieve a comprehensive concentration were"
"dispersed by the passage of the village street of Caddington, the"
"passing of a goggled car-load of motorists, and the struggles of a"
"stable lad mounted on one recalcitrant horse and leading another. When"
"she got back to her questions again in the monotonous high-road that led"
"up the hill, she found the image of Mr. Manning central in her mind."
"He stood there, large and dark, enunciating, in his clear voice from"
"beneath his large mustache, clear flat sentences, deliberately kindly."
"He proposed, he wanted to possess her! He loved her."
"Ann Veronica felt no repulsion at the prospect. That Mr. Manning loved"
"her presented itself to her bloodlessly, stilled from any imaginative"
"quiver or thrill of passion or disgust. The relationship seemed to have"
"almost as much to do with blood and body as a mortgage. It was something"
"that would create a mutual claim, a relationship. It was in another"
"world from that in which men will die for a kiss, and touching hands"
"lights fires that burn up lives--the world of romance, the world of"
"passionately beautiful things."
"But that other world, in spite of her resolute exclusion of it, was"
"always looking round corners and peeping through chinks and crannies,"
"and rustling and raiding into the order in which she chose to live,"
"shining out of pictures at her, echoing in lyrics and music; it invaded"
"her dreams, it wrote up broken and enigmatical sentences upon the"
"passage walls of her mind. She was aware of it now as if it were a"
"voice shouting outside a house, shouting passionate verities in a hot"
"sunlight, a voice that cries while people talk insincerely in a darkened"
"room and pretend not to hear. Its shouting now did in some occult manner"
"convey a protest that Mr. Manning would on no account do, though he"
"was tall and dark and handsome and kind, and thirty-five and adequately"
"prosperous, and all that a husband should be. But there was, it"
"insisted, no mobility in his face, no movement, nothing about him that"
"warmed. If Ann Veronica could have put words to that song they"
"would have been, \"Hot-blooded marriage or none!\" but she was far too"
"indistinct in this matter to frame any words at all."
"\"I don't love him,\" said Ann Veronica, getting a gleam. \"I don't see"
"that his being a good sort matters. That really settles about that...."
"But it means no end of a row.\""
"For a time she sat on a rail before leaving the road for the downland"
"turf. \"But I wish,\" she said, \"I had some idea what I was really up to.\""
"Her thoughts went into solution for a time, while she listened to a lark"
"singing."
"\"Marriage and mothering,\" said Ann Veronica, with her mind crystallizing"
"out again as the lark dropped to the nest in the turf. \"And all the rest"
"of it perhaps is a song.\""
"Part 3"
"Her mind got back to the Fadden Ball."
"She meant to go, she meant to go, she meant to go. Nothing would stop"
"her, and she was prepared to face the consequences. Suppose her father"
"turned her out of doors! She did not care, she meant to go. She would"
"just walk out of the house and go...."
"She thought of her costume in some detail and with considerable"
"satisfaction, and particularly of a very jolly property dagger with"
"large glass jewels in the handle, that reposed in a drawer in her room."
"She was to be a Corsair's Bride. \"Fancy stabbing a man for jealousy!\""
"she thought. \"You'd have to think how to get in between his bones.\""
"She thought of her father, and with an effort dismissed him from her"
"mind."
"She tried to imagine the collective effect of the Fadden Ball; she had"
"never seen a fancy-dress gathering in her life. Mr. Manning came into"
"her thoughts again, an unexpected, tall, dark, self-contained presence"
"at the Fadden. One might suppose him turning up; he knew a lot of clever"
"people, and some of them might belong to the class. What would he come"
"as?"
"Presently she roused herself with a guilty start from the task of"
"dressing and re-dressing Mr. Manning in fancy costume, as though he"
"was a doll. She had tried him as a Crusader, in which guise he seemed"
"plausible but heavy--\"There IS something heavy about him; I wonder if"
"it's his mustache?\"--and as a Hussar, which made him preposterous, and"
"as a Black Brunswicker, which was better, and as an Arab sheik. Also"
"she had tried him as a dragoman and as a gendarme, which seemed the most"
"suitable of all to his severely handsome, immobile profile. She felt"
"he would tell people the way, control traffic, and refuse admission"
"to public buildings with invincible correctness and the very finest"
"explicit feelings possible. For each costume she had devised a suitable"
"form of matrimonial refusal. \"Oh, Lord!\" she said, discovering what she"
"was up to, and dropped lightly from the fence upon the turf and went on"
"her way toward the crest."
"\"I shall never marry,\" said Ann Veronica, resolutely; \"I'm not the sort."
"That's why it's so important I should take my own line now.\""
"Part 4"
"Ann Veronica's ideas of marriage were limited and unsystematic. Her"
"teachers and mistresses had done their best to stamp her mind with an"
"ineradicable persuasion that it was tremendously important, and on no"
"account to be thought about. Her first intimations of marriage as a fact"
"of extreme significance in a woman's life had come with the marriage of"
"Alice and the elopement of her second sister, Gwen."
"These convulsions occurred when Ann Veronica was about twelve. There"
"was a gulf of eight years between her and the youngest of her brace of"
"sisters--an impassable gulf inhabited chaotically by two noisy brothers."
"These sisters moved in a grown-up world inaccessible to Ann Veronica's"
"sympathies, and to a large extent remote from her curiosity. She got"
"into rows through meddling with their shoes and tennis-rackets, and had"
"moments of carefully concealed admiration when she was privileged to see"
"them just before her bedtime, rather radiantly dressed in white or pink"
"or amber and prepared to go out with her mother. She thought Alice a bit"
"of a sneak, an opinion her brothers shared, and Gwen rather a snatch"
"at meals. She saw nothing of their love-making, and came home from her"
"boarding-school in a state of decently suppressed curiosity for Alice's"
"wedding."
"Her impressions of this cardinal ceremony were rich and confused,"
"complicated by a quite transitory passion that awakened no reciprocal"
"fire for a fat curly headed cousin in black velveteen and a lace"
"collar, who assisted as a page. She followed him about persistently, and"
"succeeded, after a brisk, unchivalrous struggle (in which he pinched and"
"asked her to \"cheese it\"), in kissing him among the raspberries behind"
"the greenhouse. Afterward her brother Roddy, also strange in velveteen,"
"feeling rather than knowing of this relationship, punched this Adonis's"
"head."
"A marriage in the house proved to be exciting but extremely"
"disorganizing. Everything seemed designed to unhinge the mind and"
"make the cat wretched. All the furniture was moved, all the meals were"
"disarranged, and everybody, Ann Veronica included, appeared in new,"
"bright costumes. She had to wear cream and a brown sash and a short"
"frock and her hair down, and Gwen cream and a brown sash and a long"
"skirt and her hair up. And her mother, looking unusually alert and"
"hectic, wore cream and brown also, made up in a more complicated manner."
"Ann Veronica was much impressed by a mighty trying on and altering and"
"fussing about Alice's \"things\"--Alice was being re-costumed from garret"
"to cellar, with a walking-dress and walking-boots to measure, and a"
"bride's costume of the most ravishing description, and stockings and"
"such like beyond the dreams of avarice--and a constant and increasing"
"dripping into the house of irrelevant remarkable objects, such as--"
"Real lace bedspread;"
"Gilt travelling clock;"
"Ornamental pewter plaque;"
"Salad bowl (silver mounted) and servers;"
"Madgett's \"English Poets\" (twelve volumes), bound purple morocco;"
"Etc., etc."
"Through all this flutter of novelty there came and went a solicitous,"
"preoccupied, almost depressed figure. It was Doctor Ralph, formerly"
"the partner of Doctor Stickell in the Avenue, and now with a thriving"
"practice of his own in Wamblesmith. He had shaved his side-whiskers and"
"come over in flannels, but he was still indisputably the same person"
"who had attended Ann Veronica for the measles and when she swallowed"
"the fish-bone. But his role was altered, and he was now playing the"
"bridegroom in this remarkable drama. Alice was going to be Mrs. Ralph."
"He came in apologetically; all the old \"Well, and how ARE we?\" note"
"gone; and once he asked Ann Veronica, almost furtively,"
"\"How's Alice getting on, Vee?\" Finally, on the Day, he appeared like"
"his old professional self transfigured, in the most beautiful light gray"
"trousers Ann Veronica had ever seen and a new shiny silk hat with a most"
"becoming roll...."
"It was not simply that all the rooms were rearranged and everybody"
"dressed in unusual fashions, and all the routines of life abolished and"
"put away: people's tempers and emotions also seemed strangely disturbed"
"and shifted about. Her father was distinctly irascible, and disposed"
"more than ever to hide away among the petrological things--the study was"
"turned out. At table he carved in a gloomy but resolute manner. On the"
"Day he had trumpet-like outbreaks of cordiality, varied by a watchful"
"preoccupation. Gwen and Alice were fantastically friendly, which seemed"
"to annoy him, and Mrs. Stanley was throughout enigmatical, with an"
"anxious eye on her husband and Alice."
"There was a confused impression of livery carriages and whips with white"
"favors, people fussily wanting other people to get in before them,"
"and then the church. People sat in unusual pews, and a wide margin of"
"hassocky emptiness intervened between the ceremony and the walls."
"Ann Veronica had a number of fragmentary impressions of Alice strangely"
"transfigured in bridal raiment. It seemed to make her sister downcast"
"beyond any precedent. The bridesmaids and pages got rather jumbled"
"in the aisle, and she had an effect of Alice's white back and"
"sloping shoulders and veiled head receding toward the altar. In some"
"incomprehensible way that back view made her feel sorry for Alice. Also"
"she remembered very vividly the smell of orange blossom, and Alice,"
"drooping and spiritless, mumbling responses, facing Doctor Ralph, while"
"the Rev. Edward Bribble stood between them with an open book. Doctor"
"Ralph looked kind and large, and listened to Alice's responses as though"
"he was listening to symptoms and thought that on the whole she was"
"progressing favorably."
"And afterward her mother and Alice kissed long and clung to each other."
"And Doctor Ralph stood by looking considerate. He and her father shook"
"hands manfully."
"Ann Veronica had got quite interested in Mr. Bribble's rendering of the"
"service--he had the sort of voice that brings out things--and was still"
"teeming with ideas about it when finally a wild outburst from the organ"
"made it clear that, whatever snivelling there might be down in the"
"chancel, that excellent wind instrument was, in its Mendelssohnian"
"way, as glad as ever it could be. \"Pump, pump, per-um-pump, Pum, Pump,"
"Per-um....\""
"The wedding-breakfast was for Ann Veronica a spectacle of the unreal"
"consuming the real; she liked that part very well, until she was"
"carelessly served against her expressed wishes with mayonnaise. She"
"was caught by an uncle, whose opinion she valued, making faces at Roddy"
"because he had exulted at this."
"Of the vast mass of these impressions Ann Veronica could make nothing"
"at the time; there they were--Fact! She stored them away in a mind"
"naturally retentive, as a squirrel stores away nuts, for further"
"digestion. Only one thing emerged with any reasonable clarity in her"
"mind at once, and that was that unless she was saved from drowning by"
"an unmarried man, in which case the ceremony is unavoidable, or totally"
"destitute of under-clothing, and so driven to get a trousseau, in which"
"hardship a trousseau would certainly be \"ripping,\" marriage was an"
"experience to be strenuously evaded."
"When they were going home she asked her mother why she and Gwen and"
"Alice had cried."
"\"Ssh!\" said her mother, and then added, \"A little natural feeling,"
"dear.\""
"\"But didn't Alice want to marry Doctor Ralph?\""
"\"Oh, ssh, Vee!\" said her mother, with an evasion as patent as an"
"advertisement board. \"I am sure she will be very happy indeed with"
"Doctor Ralph.\""
"But Ann Veronica was by no means sure of that until she went over"
"to Wamblesmith and saw her sister, very remote and domestic and"
"authoritative, in a becoming tea-gown, in command of Doctor Ralph's"
"home. Doctor Ralph came in to tea and put his arm round Alice and kissed"
"her, and Alice called him \"Squiggles,\" and stood in the shelter of his"
"arms for a moment with an expression of satisfied proprietorship. She"
"HAD cried, Ann Veronica knew. There had been fusses and scenes dimly"
"apprehended through half-open doors. She had heard Alice talking and"
"crying at the same time, a painful noise. Perhaps marriage hurt. But now"
"it was all over, and Alice was getting on well. It reminded Ann Veronica"
"of having a tooth stopped."
"And after that Alice became remoter than ever, and, after a time, ill."
"Then she had a baby and became as old as any really grown-up person, or"
"older, and very dull. Then she and her husband went off to a Yorkshire"
"practice, and had four more babies, none of whom photographed well, and"
"so she passed beyond the sphere of Ann Veronica's sympathies altogether."
"Part 5"
"The Gwen affair happened when she was away at school at"
"Marticombe-on-Sea, a term before she went to the High School, and was"
"never very clear to her."
"Her mother missed writing for a week, and then she wrote in an unusual"
"key. \"My dear,\" the letter ran, \"I have to tell you that your sister"
"Gwen has offended your father very much. I hope you will always love"
"her, but I want you to remember she has offended your father and married"
"without his consent. Your father is very angry, and will not have her"
"name mentioned in his hearing. She has married some one he could not"
"approve of, and gone right away....\""
"When the next holidays came Ann Veronica's mother was ill, and Gwen was"
"in the sick-room when Ann Veronica returned home. She was in one of her"
"old walking-dresses, her hair was done in an unfamiliar manner, she wore"
"a wedding-ring, and she looked as if she had been crying."
"\"Hello, Gwen!\" said Ann Veronica, trying to put every one at their ease."
"\"Been and married?... What's the name of the happy man?\""
"Gwen owned to \"Fortescue.\""
"\"Got a photograph of him or anything?\" said Ann Veronica, after kissing"
"her mother."
"Gwen made an inquiry, and, directed by Mrs. Stanley, produced a portrait"
"from its hiding-place in the jewel-drawer under the mirror. It presented"
"a clean-shaven face with a large Corinthian nose, hair tremendously"
"waving off the forehead and more chin and neck than is good for a man."
"\"LOOKS all right,\" said Ann Veronica, regarding him with her head first"
"on one side and then on the other, and trying to be agreeable. \"What's"
"the objection?\""
"\"I suppose she ought to know?\" said Gwen to her mother, trying to alter"
"the key of the conversation."
"\"You see, Vee,\" said Mrs. Stanley, \"Mr. Fortescue is an actor, and your"
"father does not approve of the profession.\""
"\"Oh!\" said Ann Veronica. \"I thought they made knights of actors?\""
"\"They may of Hal some day,\" said Gwen. \"But it's a long business.\""
"\"I suppose this makes you an actress?\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"I don't know whether I shall go on,\" said Gwen, a novel note of"
"languorous professionalism creeping into her voice. \"The other women"
"don't much like it if husband and wife work together, and I don't think"
"Hal would like me to act away from him.\""
"Ann Veronica regarded her sister with a new respect, but the traditions"
"of family life are strong. \"I don't suppose you'll be able to do it"
"much,\" said Ann Veronica."
"Later Gwen's trouble weighed so heavily on Mrs. Stanley in her illness"
"that her husband consented to receive Mr. Fortescue in the drawing-room,"
"and actually shake hands with him in an entirely hopeless manner and"
"hope everything would turn out for the best."
"The forgiveness and reconciliation was a cold and formal affair, and"
"afterwards her father went off gloomily to his study, and Mr. Fortescue"
"rambled round the garden with soft, propitiatory steps, the Corinthian"
"nose upraised and his hands behind his back, pausing to look long and"
"hard at the fruit-trees against the wall."
"Ann Veronica watched him from the dining-room window, and after some"
"moments of maidenly hesitation rambled out into the garden in a reverse"
"direction to Mr. Fortescue's steps, and encountered him with an air of"
"artless surprise."
"\"Hello!\" said Ann Veronica, with arms akimbo and a careless, breathless"
"manner. \"You Mr. Fortescue?\""
"\"At your service. You Ann Veronica?\""
"\"Rather! I say--did you marry Gwen?\""
"\"Yes.\""
"\"Why?\""
"Mr. Fortescue raised his eyebrows and assumed a light-comedy expression."
"\"I suppose I fell in love with her, Ann Veronica.\""
"\"Rum,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Have you got to keep her now?\""
"\"To the best of my ability,\" said Mr. Fortescue, with a bow."
"\"Have you much ability?\" asked Ann Veronica."
"Mr. Fortescue tried to act embarrassment in order to conceal its"
"reality, and Ann Veronica went on to ask a string of questions about"
"acting, and whether her sister would act, and was she beautiful enough"
"for it, and who would make her dresses, and so on."
"As a matter of fact Mr. Fortescue had not much ability to keep her"
"sister, and a little while after her mother's death Ann Veronica"
"met Gwen suddenly on the staircase coming from her father's study,"
"shockingly dingy in dusty mourning and tearful and resentful, and after"
"that Gwen receded from the Morningside Park world, and not even the"
"begging letters and distressful communications that her father and aunt"
"received, but only a vague intimation of dreadfulness, a leakage of"
"incidental comment, flashes of paternal anger at \"that blackguard,\" came"
"to Ann Veronica's ears."
"Part 6"
"These were Ann Veronica's leading cases in the question of marriage."
"They were the only real marriages she had seen clearly. For the rest,"
"she derived her ideas of the married state from the observed behavior of"
"married women, which impressed her in Morningside Park as being tied and"
"dull and inelastic in comparison with the life of the young, and from a"
"remarkably various reading among books. As a net result she had come to"
"think of all married people much as one thinks of insects that have"
"lost their wings, and of her sisters as new hatched creatures who had"
"scarcely for a moment had wings. She evolved a dim image of herself"
"cooped up in a house under the benevolent shadow of Mr. Manning."
"Who knows?--on the analogy of \"Squiggles\" she might come to call him"
"\"Mangles!\""
"\"I don't think I can ever marry any one,\" she said, and fell suddenly"
"into another set of considerations that perplexed her for a time. Had"
"romance to be banished from life?..."
"It was hard to part with romance, but she had never thirsted so keenly"
"to go on with her University work in her life as she did that day. She"
"had never felt so acutely the desire for free initiative, for a life"
"unhampered by others. At any cost! Her brothers had it practically--at"
"least they had it far more than it seemed likely she would unless she"
"exerted herself with quite exceptional vigor. Between her and the fair,"
"far prospect of freedom and self-development manoeuvred Mr. Manning, her"
"aunt and father, neighbors, customs, traditions, forces. They seemed to"
"her that morning to be all armed with nets and prepared to throw them"
"over her directly her movements became in any manner truly free."
"She had a feeling as though something had dropped from her eyes, as"
"though she had just discovered herself for the first time--discovered"
"herself as a sleep-walker might do, abruptly among dangers, hindrances,"
"and perplexities, on the verge of a cardinal crisis."
"The life of a girl presented itself to her as something happy and"
"heedless and unthinking, yet really guided and controlled by others, and"
"going on amidst unsuspected screens and concealments."
"And in its way it was very well. Then suddenly with a rush came reality,"
"came \"growing up\"; a hasty imperative appeal for seriousness, for"
"supreme seriousness. The Ralphs and Mannings and Fortescues came down"
"upon the raw inexperience, upon the blinking ignorance of the newcomer;"
"and before her eyes were fairly open, before she knew what had"
"happened, a new set of guides and controls, a new set of obligations and"
"responsibilities and limitations, had replaced the old. \"I want to be"
"a Person,\" said Ann Veronica to the downs and the open sky; \"I will not"
"have this happen to me, whatever else may happen in its place.\""
"Ann Veronica had three things very definitely settled by the time when,"
"a little after mid-day, she found herself perched up on a gate between a"
"bridle-path and a field that commanded the whole wide stretch of country"
"between Chalking and Waldersham. Firstly, she did not intend to marry at"
"all, and particularly she did not mean to marry Mr. Manning; secondly,"
"by some measure or other, she meant to go on with her studies, not at"
"the Tredgold Schools but at the Imperial College; and, thirdly, she was,"
"as an immediate and decisive act, a symbol of just exactly where she"
"stood, a declaration of free and adult initiative, going that night to"
"the Fadden Ball."
"But the possible attitude of her father she had still to face. So far"
"she had the utmost difficulty in getting on to that vitally important"
"matter. The whole of that relationship persisted in remaining obscure."
"What would happen when next morning she returned to Morningside Park?"
"He couldn't turn her out of doors. But what he could do or might do she"
"could not imagine. She was not afraid of violence, but she was afraid of"
"something mean, some secondary kind of force. Suppose he stopped all her"
"allowance, made it imperative that she should either stay ineffectually"
"resentful at home or earn a living for herself at once.... It"
"appeared highly probable to her that he would stop her allowance."
"What can a girl do?"
"Somewhere at this point Ann Veronica's speculations were interrupted"
"and turned aside by the approach of a horse and rider. Mr. Ramage, that"
"iron-gray man of the world, appeared dressed in a bowler hat and a suit"
"of hard gray, astride of a black horse. He pulled rein at the sight of"
"her, saluted, and regarded her with his rather too protuberant eyes. The"
"girl's gaze met his in interested inquiry."
"\"You've got my view,\" he said, after a pensive second. \"I always get off"
"here and lean over that rail for a bit. May I do so to-day?\""
"\"It's your gate,\" she said, amiably; \"you got it first. It's for you to"
"say if I may sit on it.\""
"He slipped off the horse. \"Let me introduce you to Caesar,\" he said;"
"and she patted Caesar's neck, and remarked how soft his nose was, and"
"secretly deplored the ugliness of equine teeth. Ramage tethered the"
"horse to the farther gate-post, and Caesar blew heavily and began to"
"investigate the hedge."
"Ramage leaned over the gate at Ann Veronica's side, and for a moment"
"there was silence."
"He made some obvious comments on the wide view warming toward its"
"autumnal blaze that spread itself in hill and valley, wood and village,"
"below."
"\"It's as broad as life,\" said Mr. Ramage, regarding it and putting a"
"well-booted foot up on the bottom rail."
"Part 7"
"\"And what are you doing here, young lady,\" he said, looking up at her"
"face, \"wandering alone so far from home?\""
"\"I like long walks,\" said Ann Veronica, looking down on him."
"\"Solitary walks?\""
"\"That's the point of them. I think over all sorts of things.\""
"\"Problems?\""
"\"Sometimes quite difficult problems.\""
"\"You're lucky to live in an age when you can do so. Your mother,"
"for instance, couldn't. She had to do her thinking at home--under"
"inspection.\""
"She looked down on him thoughtfully, and he let his admiration of her"
"free young poise show in his face."
"\"I suppose things have changed?\" she said."
"\"Never was such an age of transition.\""
"She wondered what to. Mr. Ramage did not know. \"Sufficient unto me is"
"the change thereof,\" he said, with all the effect of an epigram."
"\"I must confess,\" he said, \"the New Woman and the New Girl intrigue me"
"profoundly. I am one of those people who are interested in women, more"
"interested than I am in anything else. I don't conceal it. And the"
"change, the change of attitude! The way all the old clingingness"
"has been thrown aside is amazing. And all the old--the old trick of"
"shrinking up like a snail at a touch. If you had lived twenty years ago"
"you would have been called a Young Person, and it would have been your"
"chief duty in life not to know, never to have heard of, and never to"
"understand.\""
"\"There's quite enough still,\" said Ann Veronica, smiling, \"that one"
"doesn't understand.\""
"\"Quite. But your role would have been to go about saying, 'I beg your"
"pardon' in a reproving tone to things you understood quite well in your"
"heart and saw no harm in. That terrible Young Person! she's vanished."
"Lost, stolen, or strayed, the Young Person!... I hope we may never"
"find her again.\""
"He rejoiced over this emancipation. \"While that lamb was about every man"
"of any spirit was regarded as a dangerous wolf. We wore invisible chains"
"and invisible blinkers. Now, you and I can gossip at a gate, and Honi"
"soit qui mal y pense. The change has given man one good thing he never"
"had before,\" he said. \"Girl friends. And I am coming to believe the best"
"as well as the most beautiful friends a man can have are girl friends.\""
"He paused, and went on, after a keen look at her:"
"\"I had rather gossip to a really intelligent girl than to any man"
"alive.\""
"\"I suppose we ARE more free than we were?\" said Ann Veronica, keeping"
"the question general."
"\"Oh, there's no doubt of it! Since the girls of the eighties broke"
"bounds and sailed away on bicycles--my young days go back to the very"
"beginnings of that--it's been one triumphant relaxation.\""
"\"Relaxation, perhaps. But are we any more free?\""
"\"Well?\""
"\"I mean we've long strings to tether us, but we are bound all the same."
"A woman isn't much freer--in reality.\""
"Mr. Ramage demurred."
"\"One runs about,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"Yes.\""
"\"But it's on condition one doesn't do anything.\""
"\"Do what?\""
"\"Oh!--anything.\""
"He looked interrogation with a faint smile."
"\"It seems to me it comes to earning one's living in the long run,\" said"
"Ann Veronica, coloring faintly. \"Until a girl can go away as a son does"
"and earn her independent income, she's still on a string. It may be a"
"long string, long enough if you like to tangle up all sorts of people;"
"but there it is! If the paymaster pulls, home she must go. That's what I"
"mean.\""
"Mr. Ramage admitted the force of that. He was a little impressed by"
"Ann Veronica's metaphor of the string, which, indeed, she owed to Hetty"
"Widgett. \"YOU wouldn't like to be independent?\" he asked, abruptly. \"I"
"mean REALLY independent. On your own. It isn't such fun as it seems.\""
"\"Every one wants to be independent,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Every one. Man"
"or woman.\""
"\"And you?\""
"\"Rather!\""
"\"I wonder why?\""
"\"There's no why. It's just to feel--one owns one's self.\""
"\"Nobody does that,\" said Ramage, and kept silence for a moment."
"\"But a boy--a boy goes out into the world and presently stands on his"
"own feet. He buys his own clothes, chooses his own company, makes his"
"own way of living.\""
"\"You'd like to do that?\""
"\"Exactly.\""
"\"Would you like to be a boy?\""
"\"I wonder! It's out of the question, any way.\""
"Ramage reflected. \"Why don't you?\""
"\"Well, it might mean rather a row.\""
"\"I know--\" said Ramage, with sympathy."
"\"And besides,\" said Ann Veronica, sweeping that aspect aside, \"what"
"could I do? A boy sails out into a trade or profession. But--it's one"
"of the things I've just been thinking over. Suppose--suppose a girl"
"did want to start in life, start in life for herself--\" She looked him"
"frankly in the eyes. \"What ought she to do?\""
"\"Suppose you--\""
"\"Yes, suppose I--\""
"He felt that his advice was being asked. He became a little more"
"personal and intimate. \"I wonder what you could do?\" he said. \"I should"
"think YOU could do all sorts of things...."
"\"What ought you to do?\" He began to produce his knowledge of the world"
"for her benefit, jerkily and allusively, and with a strong, rank flavor"
"of \"savoir faire.\" He took an optimist view of her chances. Ann Veronica"
"listened thoughtfully, with her eyes on the turf, and now and then she"
"asked a question or looked up to discuss a point. In the meanwhile,"
"as he talked, he scrutinized her face, ran his eyes over her careless,"
"gracious poise, wondered hard about her. He described her privately to"
"himself as a splendid girl. It was clear she wanted to get away from"
"home, that she was impatient to get away from home. Why? While the front"
"of his mind was busy warning her not to fall into the hopeless miseries"
"of underpaid teaching, and explaining his idea that for women of"
"initiative, quite as much as for men, the world of business had by far"
"the best chances, the back chambers of his brain were busy with the"
"problem of that \"Why?\""
"His first idea as a man of the world was to explain her unrest by a"
"lover, some secret or forbidden or impossible lover. But he dismissed"
"that because then she would ask her lover and not him all these things."
"Restlessness, then, was the trouble, simple restlessness: home bored"
"her. He could quite understand the daughter of Mr. Stanley being bored"
"and feeling limited. But was that enough? Dim, formless suspicions"
"of something more vital wandered about his mind. Was the young lady"
"impatient for experience? Was she adventurous? As a man of the world he"
"did not think it becoming to accept maidenly calm as anything more than"
"a mask. Warm life was behind that always, even if it slept. If it"
"was not an actual personal lover, it still might be the lover not yet"
"incarnate, not yet perhaps suspected...."
"He had diverged only a little from the truth when he said that his"
"chief interest in life was women. It wasn't so much women as Woman that"
"engaged his mind. His was the Latin turn of thinking; he had fallen"
"in love at thirteen, and he was still capable--he prided himself--of"
"falling in love. His invalid wife and her money had been only the thin"
"thread that held his life together; beaded on that permanent relation"
"had been an inter-weaving series of other feminine experiences,"
"disturbing, absorbing, interesting, memorable affairs. Each one had"
"been different from the others, each had had a quality all its own, a"
"distinctive freshness, a distinctive beauty. He could not understand how"
"men could live ignoring this one predominant interest, this wonderful"
"research into personality and the possibilities of pleasing, these"
"complex, fascinating expeditions that began in interest and mounted to"
"the supremest, most passionate intimacy. All the rest of his existence"
"was subordinate to this pursuit; he lived for it, worked for it, kept"
"himself in training for it."
"So while he talked to this girl of work and freedom, his slightly"
"protuberant eyes were noting the gracious balance of her limbs and body"
"across the gate, the fine lines of her chin and neck. Her grave fine"
"face, her warm clear complexion, had already aroused his curiosity as he"
"had gone to and fro in Morningside Park, and here suddenly he was"
"near to her and talking freely and intimately. He had found her in"
"a communicative mood, and he used the accumulated skill of years in"
"turning that to account."
"She was pleased and a little flattered by his interest and sympathy. She"
"became eager to explain herself, to show herself in the right light. He"
"was manifestly exerting his mind for her, and she found herself fully"
"disposed to justify his interest."
"She, perhaps, displayed herself rather consciously as a fine"
"person unduly limited. She even touched lightly on her father's"
"unreasonableness."
"\"I wonder,\" said Ramage, \"that more girls don't think as you do and want"
"to strike out in the world.\""
"And then he speculated. \"I wonder if you will?\""
"\"Let me say one thing,\" he said. \"If ever you do and I can help you"
"in any way, by advice or inquiry or recommendation--You see, I'm no"
"believer in feminine incapacity, but I do perceive there is such a thing"
"as feminine inexperience. As a sex you're a little under-trained--in"
"affairs. I'd take it--forgive me if I seem a little urgent--as a sort of"
"proof of friendliness. I can imagine nothing more pleasant in life than"
"to help you, because I know it would pay to help you. There's something"
"about you, a little flavor of Will, I suppose, that makes one feel--good"
"luck about you and success....\""
"And while he talked and watched her as he talked, she answered, and"
"behind her listening watched and thought about him. She liked the"
"animated eagerness of his manner."
"His mind seemed to be a remarkably full one; his knowledge of detailed"
"reality came in just where her own mind was most weakly equipped."
"Through all he said ran one quality that pleased her--the quality of a"
"man who feels that things can be done, that one need not wait for the"
"world to push one before one moved. Compared with her father and Mr."
"Manning and the men in \"fixed\" positions generally that she knew,"
"Ramage, presented by himself, had a fine suggestion of freedom, of"
"power, of deliberate and sustained adventure...."
"She was particularly charmed by his theory of friendship. It was really"
"very jolly to talk to a man in this way--who saw the woman in her and"
"did not treat her as a child. She was inclined to think that perhaps"
"for a girl the converse of his method was the case; an older man, a"
"man beyond the range of anything \"nonsensical,\" was, perhaps, the most"
"interesting sort of friend one could meet. But in that reservation it"
"may be she went a little beyond the converse of his view...."
"They got on wonderfully well together. They talked for the better part"
"of an hour, and at last walked together to the junction of highroad"
"and the bridle-path. There, after protestations of friendliness and"
"helpfulness that were almost ardent, he mounted a little clumsily and"
"rode off at an amiable pace, looking his best, making a leg with"
"his riding gaiters, smiling and saluting, while Ann Veronica turned"
"northward and so came to Micklechesil. There, in a little tea and"
"sweet-stuff shop, she bought and consumed slowly and absent-mindedly the"
"insufficient nourishment that is natural to her sex on such occasions."
"CHAPTER THE FOURTH"
"THE CRISIS"
"Part 1"
"We left Miss Stanley with Ann Veronica's fancy dress in her hands and"
"her eyes directed to Ann Veronica's pseudo-Turkish slippers."
"When Mr. Stanley came home at a quarter to six--an earlier train by"
"fifteen minutes than he affected--his sister met him in the hall with"
"a hushed expression. \"I'm so glad you're here, Peter,\" she said. \"She"
"means to go.\""
"\"Go!\" he said. \"Where?\""
"\"To that ball.\""
"\"What ball?\" The question was rhetorical. He knew."
"\"I believe she's dressing up-stairs--now.\""
"\"Then tell her to undress, confound her!\" The City had been thoroughly"
"annoying that day, and he was angry from the outset."
"Miss Stanley reflected on this proposal for a moment."
"\"I don't think she will,\" she said."
"\"She must,\" said Mr. Stanley, and went into his study. His sister"
"followed. \"She can't go now. She'll have to wait for dinner,\" he said,"
"uncomfortably."
"\"She's going to have some sort of meal with the Widgetts down the"
"Avenue, and go up with them."
"\"She told you that?\""
"\"Yes.\""
"\"When?\""
"\"At tea.\""
"\"But why didn't you prohibit once for all the whole thing? How dared she"
"tell you that?\""
"\"Out of defiance. She just sat and told me that was her arrangement."
"I've never seen her quite so sure of herself.\""
"\"What did you say?\""
"\"I said, 'My dear Veronica! how can you think of such things?'\""
"\"And then?\""
"\"She had two more cups of tea and some cake, and told me of her walk.\""
"\"She'll meet somebody one of these days--walking about like that.\""
"\"She didn't say she'd met any one.\""
"\"But didn't you say some more about that ball?\""
"\"I said everything I could say as soon as I realized she was trying to"
"avoid the topic. I said, 'It is no use your telling me about this walk"
"and pretend I've been told about the ball, because you haven't. Your"
"father has forbidden you to go!'\""
"\"Well?\""
"\"She said, 'I hate being horrid to you and father, but I feel it my duty"
"to go to that ball!'\""
"\"Felt it her duty!\""
"\"'Very well,' I said, 'then I wash my hands of the whole business. Your"
"disobedience be upon your own head.'\""
"\"But that is flat rebellion!\" said Mr. Stanley, standing on the"
"hearthrug with his back to the unlit gas-fire. \"You ought at once--you"
"ought at once to have told her that. What duty does a girl owe to any"
"one before her father? Obedience to him, that is surely the first law."
"What CAN she put before that?\" His voice began to rise. \"One would think"
"I had said nothing about the matter. One would think I had agreed to"
"her going. I suppose this is what she learns in her infernal London"
"colleges. I suppose this is the sort of damned rubbish--\""
"\"Oh! Ssh, Peter!\" cried Miss Stanley."
"He stopped abruptly. In the pause a door could be heard opening and"
"closing on the landing up-stairs. Then light footsteps became audible,"
"descending the staircase with a certain deliberation and a faint rustle"
"of skirts."
"\"Tell her,\" said Mr. Stanley, with an imperious gesture, \"to come in"
"here.\""
"Part 2"
"Miss Stanley emerged from the study and stood watching Ann Veronica"
"descend."
"The girl was flushed with excitement, bright-eyed, and braced for a"
"struggle; her aunt had never seen her looking so fine or so pretty."
"Her fancy dress, save for the green-gray stockings, the pseudo-Turkish"
"slippers, and baggy silk trousered ends natural to a Corsair's bride,"
"was hidden in a large black-silk-hooded opera-cloak. Beneath the hood"
"it was evident that her rebellious hair was bound up with red silk, and"
"fastened by some device in her ears (unless she had them pierced, which"
"was too dreadful a thing to suppose!) were long brass filigree earrings."
"\"I'm just off, aunt,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"Your father is in the study and wishes to speak to you.\""
"Ann Veronica hesitated, and then stood in the open doorway and regarded"
"her father's stern presence. She spoke with an entirely false note of"
"cheerful off-handedness. \"I'm just in time to say good-bye before I go,"
"father. I'm going up to London with the Widgetts to that ball.\""
"\"Now look here, Ann Veronica,\" said Mr. Stanley, \"just a moment. You are"
"NOT going to that ball!\""
"Ann Veronica tried a less genial, more dignified note."
"\"I thought we had discussed that, father.\""
"\"You are not going to that ball! You are not going out of this house in"
"that get-up!\""
"Ann Veronica tried yet more earnestly to treat him, as she would treat"
"any man, with an insistence upon her due of masculine respect. \"You"
"see,\" she said, very gently, \"I AM going. I am sorry to seem to disobey"
"you, but I am. I wish\"--she found she had embarked on a bad sentence--\"I"
"wish we needn't have quarrelled.\""
"She stopped abruptly, and turned about toward the front door. In a"
"moment he was beside her. \"I don't think you can have heard me, Vee,\""
"he said, with intensely controlled fury. \"I said you were\"--he"
"shouted--\"NOT TO GO!\""
"She made, and overdid, an immense effort to be a princess. She tossed"
"her head, and, having no further words, moved toward the door. Her"
"father intercepted her, and for a moment she and he struggled with their"
"hands upon the latch. A common rage flushed their faces. \"Let go!\" she"
"gasped at him, a blaze of anger."
"\"Veronica!\" cried Miss Stanley, warningly, and, \"Peter!\""
"For a moment they seemed on the verge of an altogether desperate"
"scuffle. Never for a moment had violence come between these two since"
"long ago he had, in spite of her mother's protest in the background,"
"carried her kicking and squalling to the nursery for some forgotten"
"crime. With something near to horror they found themselves thus"
"confronted."
"The door was fastened by a catch and a latch with an inside key, to"
"which at night a chain and two bolts were added. Carefully abstaining"
"from thrusting against each other, Ann Veronica and her father began an"
"absurdly desperate struggle, the one to open the door, the other to keep"
"it fastened. She seized the key, and he grasped her hand and squeezed"
"it roughly and painfully between the handle and the ward as she tried to"
"turn it. His grip twisted her wrist. She cried out with the pain of it."
"A wild passion of shame and self-disgust swept over her. Her spirit"
"awoke in dismay to an affection in ruins, to the immense undignified"
"disaster that had come to them."
"Abruptly she desisted, recoiled, and turned and fled up-stairs."
"She made noises between weeping and laughter as she went. She gained her"
"room, and slammed her door and locked it as though she feared violence"
"and pursuit."
"\"Oh God!\" she cried, \"Oh God!\" and flung aside her opera-cloak, and for"
"a time walked about the room--a Corsair's bride at a crisis of emotion."
"\"Why can't he reason with me,\" she said, again and again, \"instead of"
"doing this?\""
"Part 3"
"There presently came a phase in which she said: \"I WON'T stand it even"
"now. I will go to-night.\""
"She went as far as her door, then turned to the window. She opened"
"this and scrambled out--a thing she had not done for five long years of"
"adolescence--upon the leaded space above the built-out bath-room on the"
"first floor. Once upon a time she and Roddy had descended thence by the"
"drain-pipe."
"But things that a girl of sixteen may do in short skirts are not"
"things to be done by a young lady of twenty-one in fancy dress and"
"an opera-cloak, and just as she was coming unaided to an adequate"
"realization of this, she discovered Mr. Pragmar, the wholesale druggist,"
"who lived three gardens away, and who had been mowing his lawn to get"
"an appetite for dinner, standing in a fascinated attitude beside the"
"forgotten lawn-mower and watching her intently."
"She found it extremely difficult to infuse an air of quiet correctitude"
"into her return through the window, and when she was safely inside she"
"waved clinched fists and executed a noiseless dance of rage."
"When she reflected that Mr. Pragmar probably knew Mr. Ramage, and might"
"describe the affair to him, she cried \"Oh!\" with renewed vexation, and"
"repeated some steps of her dance in a new and more ecstatic measure."
"Part 4"
"At eight that evening Miss Stanley tapped at Ann Veronica's bedroom"
"door."
"\"I've brought you up some dinner, Vee,\" she said."
"Ann Veronica was lying on her bed in a darkling room staring at the"
"ceiling. She reflected before answering. She was frightfully hungry."
"She had eaten little or no tea, and her mid-day meal had been worse than"
"nothing."
"She got up and unlocked the door."
"Her aunt did not object to capital punishment or war, or the industrial"
"system or casual wards, or flogging of criminals or the Congo Free"
"State, because none of these things really got hold of her imagination;"
"but she did object, she did not like, she could not bear to think of"
"people not having and enjoying their meals. It was her distinctive test"
"of an emotional state, its interference with a kindly normal digestion."
"Any one very badly moved choked down a few mouthfuls; the symptom of"
"supreme distress was not to be able to touch a bit. So that the thought"
"of Ann Veronica up-stairs had been extremely painful for her through all"
"the silent dinner-time that night. As soon as dinner was over she went"
"into the kitchen and devoted herself to compiling a tray--not a tray"
"merely of half-cooled dinner things, but a specially prepared \"nice\""
"tray, suitable for tempting any one. With this she now entered."
"Ann Veronica found herself in the presence of the most disconcerting"
"fact in human experience, the kindliness of people you believe to be"
"thoroughly wrong. She took the tray with both hands, gulped, and gave"
"way to tears."
"Her aunt leaped unhappily to the thought of penitence."
"\"My dear,\" she began, with an affectionate hand on Ann Veronica's"
"shoulder, \"I do SO wish you would realize how it grieves your father.\""
"Ann Veronica flung away from her hand, and the pepper-pot on the tray"
"upset, sending a puff of pepper into the air and instantly filling them"
"both with an intense desire to sneeze."
"\"I don't think you see,\" she replied, with tears on her cheeks, and her"
"brows knitting, \"how it shames and, ah!--disgraces me--AH TISHU!\""
"She put down the tray with a concussion on her toilet-table."
"\"But, dear, think! He is your father. SHOOH!\""
"\"That's no reason,\" said Ann Veronica, speaking through her handkerchief"
"and stopping abruptly."
"Niece and aunt regarded each other for a moment over their"
"pocket-handkerchiefs with watery but antagonistic eyes, each far too"
"profoundly moved to see the absurdity of the position."
"\"I hope,\" said Miss Stanley, with dignity, and turned doorward with"
"features in civil warfare. \"Better state of mind,\" she gasped...."
"Ann Veronica stood in the twilight room staring at the door that had"
"slammed upon her aunt, her pocket-handkerchief rolled tightly in her"
"hand. Her soul was full of the sense of disaster. She had made her first"
"fight for dignity and freedom as a grown-up and independent Person, and"
"this was how the universe had treated her. It had neither succumbed"
"to her nor wrathfully overwhelmed her. It had thrust her back with an"
"undignified scuffle, with vulgar comedy, with an unendurable, scornful"
"grin."
"\"By God!\" said Ann Veronica for the first time in her life. \"But I will!"
"I will!\""
"CHAPTER THE FIFTH"
"THE FLIGHT TO LONDON"
"Part 1"
"Ann Veronica had an impression that she did not sleep at all that night,"
"and at any rate she got through an immense amount of feverish feeling"
"and thinking."
"What was she going to do?"
"One main idea possessed her: she must get away from home, she must"
"assert herself at once or perish. \"Very well,\" she would say, \"then I"
"must go.\" To remain, she felt, was to concede everything. And she would"
"have to go to-morrow. It was clear it must be to-morrow. If she delayed"
"a day she would delay two days, if she delayed two days she would delay"
"a week, and after a week things would be adjusted to submission forever."
"\"I'll go,\" she vowed to the night, \"or I'll die!\" She made plans and"
"estimated means and resources. These and her general preparations had"
"perhaps a certain disproportion. She had a gold watch, a very good gold"
"watch that had been her mother's, a pearl necklace that was also pretty"
"good, some unpretending rings, some silver bangles and a few other such"
"inferior trinkets, three pounds thirteen shillings unspent of her"
"dress and book allowance and a few good salable books. So equipped, she"
"proposed to set up a separate establishment in the world."
"And then she would find work."
"For most of a long and fluctuating night she was fairly confident that"
"she would find work; she knew herself to be strong, intelligent, and"
"capable by the standards of most of the girls she knew. She was not"
"quite clear how she should find it, but she felt she would. Then"
"she would write and tell her father what she had done, and put their"
"relationship on a new footing."
"That was how she projected it, and in general terms it seemed plausible"
"and possible. But in between these wider phases of comparative"
"confidence were gaps of disconcerting doubt, when the universe was"
"presented as making sinister and threatening faces at her, defying her"
"to defy, preparing a humiliating and shameful overthrow. \"I don't care,\""
"said Ann Veronica to the darkness; \"I'll fight it.\""
"She tried to plan her proceedings in detail. The only difficulties that"
"presented themselves clearly to her were the difficulties of getting"
"away from Morningside Park, and not the difficulties at the other end"
"of the journey. These were so outside her experience that she found it"
"possible to thrust them almost out of sight by saying they would be \"all"
"right\" in confident tones to herself. But still she knew they were not"
"right, and at times they became a horrible obsession as of something"
"waiting for her round the corner. She tried to imagine herself \"getting"
"something,\" to project herself as sitting down at a desk and writing,"
"or as returning after her work to some pleasantly equipped and free and"
"independent flat. For a time she furnished the flat. But even with"
"that furniture it remained extremely vague, the possible good and the"
"possible evil as well!"
"The possible evil! \"I'll go,\" said Ann Veronica for the hundredth time."
"\"I'll go. I don't care WHAT happens.\""
"She awoke out of a doze, as though she had never been sleeping. It was"
"time to get up."
"She sat on the edge of her bed and looked about her, at her room, at the"
"row of black-covered books and the pig's skull. \"I must take them,\""
"she said, to help herself over her own incredulity. \"How shall I get my"
"luggage out of the house?...\""
"The figure of her aunt, a little distant, a little propitiatory, behind"
"the coffee things, filled her with a sense of almost catastrophic"
"adventure. Perhaps she might never come back to that breakfast-room"
"again. Never! Perhaps some day, quite soon, she might regret that"
"breakfast-room. She helped herself to the remainder of the slightly"
"congealed bacon, and reverted to the problem of getting her luggage"
"out of the house. She decided to call in the help of Teddy Widgett, or,"
"failing him, of one of his sisters."
"Part 2"
"She found the younger generation of the Widgetts engaged in languid"
"reminiscences, and all, as they expressed it, a \"bit decayed.\" Every"
"one became tremendously animated when they heard that Ann Veronica had"
"failed them because she had been, as she expressed it, \"locked in.\""
"\"My God!\" said Teddy, more impressively than ever."
"\"But what are you going to do?\" asked Hetty."
"\"What can one do?\" asked Ann Veronica. \"Would you stand it? I'm going to"
"clear out.\""
"\"Clear out?\" cried Hetty."
"\"Go to London,\" said Ann Veronica."
"She had expected sympathetic admiration, but instead the whole Widgett"
"family, except Teddy, expressed a common dismay. \"But how can you?\""
"asked Constance. \"Who will you stop with?\""
"\"I shall go on my own. Take a room!\""
"\"I say!\" said Constance. \"But who's going to pay for the room?\""
"\"I've got money,\" said Ann Veronica. \"Anything is better than this--this"
"stifled life down here.\" And seeing that Hetty and Constance were"
"obviously developing objections, she plunged at once into a demand for"
"help. \"I've got nothing in the world to pack with except a toy size"
"portmanteau. Can you lend me some stuff?\""
"\"You ARE a chap!\" said Constance, and warmed only slowly from the idea"
"of dissuasion to the idea of help. But they did what they could for her."
"They agreed to lend her their hold-all and a large, formless bag which"
"they called the communal trunk. And Teddy declared himself ready to go"
"to the ends of the earth for her, and carry her luggage all the way."
"Hetty, looking out of the window--she always smoked her after-breakfast"
"cigarette at the window for the benefit of the less advanced section of"
"Morningside Park society--and trying not to raise objections, saw Miss"
"Stanley going down toward the shops."
"\"If you must go on with it,\" said Hetty, \"now's your time.\" And Ann"
"Veronica at once went back with the hold-all, trying not to hurry"
"indecently but to keep up her dignified air of being a wronged person"
"doing the right thing at a smart trot, to pack. Teddy went round by the"
"garden backs and dropped the bag over the fence. All this was exciting"
"and entertaining. Her aunt returned before the packing was done, and"
"Ann Veronica lunched with an uneasy sense of bag and hold-all packed"
"up-stairs and inadequately hidden from chance intruders by the valance"
"of the bed. She went down, flushed and light-hearted, to the Widgetts'"
"after lunch to make some final arrangements and then, as soon as her"
"aunt had retired to lie down for her usual digestive hour, took the"
"risk of the servants having the enterprise to report her proceedings"
"and carried her bag and hold-all to the garden gate, whence Teddy, in"
"a state of ecstatic service, bore them to the railway station. Then she"
"went up-stairs again, dressed herself carefully for town, put on her"
"most businesslike-looking hat, and with a wave of emotion she found it"
"hard to control, walked down to catch the 3.17 up-train."
"Teddy handed her into the second-class compartment her season-ticket"
"warranted, and declared she was \"simply splendid.\" \"If you want"
"anything,\" he said, \"or get into any trouble, wire me. I'd come back"
"from the ends of the earth. I'd do anything, Vee. It's horrible to think"
"of you!\""
"\"You're an awful brick, Teddy!\" she said."
"\"Who wouldn't be for you?\""
"The train began to move. \"You're splendid!\" said Teddy, with his hair"
"wild in the wind. \"Good luck! Good luck!\""
"She waved from the window until the bend hid him."
"She found herself alone in the train asking herself what she must do"
"next, and trying not to think of herself as cut off from home or any"
"refuge whatever from the world she had resolved to face. She felt"
"smaller and more adventurous even than she had expected to feel. \"Let"
"me see,\" she said to herself, trying to control a slight sinking of the"
"heart, \"I am going to take a room in a lodging-house because that is"
"cheaper.... But perhaps I had better get a room in an hotel to-night"
"and look round...."
"\"It's bound to be all right,\" she said."
"But her heart kept on sinking. What hotel should she go to? If she told"
"a cabman to drive to an hotel, any hotel, what would he do--or say? He"
"might drive to something dreadfully expensive, and not at all the quiet"
"sort of thing she required. Finally she decided that even for an hotel"
"she must look round, and that meanwhile she would \"book\" her luggage at"
"Waterloo. She told the porter to take it to the booking-office, and it"
"was only after a disconcerting moment or so that she found she ought to"
"have directed him to go to the cloak-room. But that was soon put right,"
"and she walked out into London with a peculiar exaltation of mind, an"
"exaltation that partook of panic and defiance, but was chiefly a sense"
"of vast unexampled release."
"She inhaled a deep breath of air--London air."
"Part 3"
"She dismissed the first hotels she passed, she scarcely knew why, mainly"
"perhaps from the mere dread of entering them, and crossed Waterloo"
"Bridge at a leisurely pace. It was high afternoon, there was no great"
"throng of foot-passengers, and many an eye from omnibus and pavement"
"rested gratefully on her fresh, trim presence as she passed young"
"and erect, with the light of determination shining through the quiet"
"self-possession of her face. She was dressed as English girls do dress"
"for town, without either coquetry or harshness: her collarless blouse"
"confessed a pretty neck, her eyes were bright and steady, and her dark"
"hair waved loosely and graciously over her ears...."
"It seemed at first the most beautiful afternoon of all time to her,"
"and perhaps the thrill of her excitement did add a distinctive and"
"culminating keenness to the day. The river, the big buildings on the"
"north bank, Westminster, and St. Paul's, were rich and wonderful with"
"the soft sunshine of London, the softest, the finest grained, the most"
"penetrating and least emphatic sunshine in the world. The very carts"
"and vans and cabs that Wellington Street poured out incessantly upon"
"the bridge seemed ripe and good in her eyes. A traffic of copious barges"
"slumbered over the face of the river-barges either altogether stagnant"
"or dreaming along in the wake of fussy tugs; and above circled, urbanely"
"voracious, the London seagulls. She had never been there before at that"
"hour, in that light, and it seemed to her as if she came to it all for"
"the first time. And this great mellow place, this London, now was hers,"
"to struggle with, to go where she pleased in, to overcome and live in."
"\"I am glad,\" she told herself, \"I came.\""
"She marked an hotel that seemed neither opulent nor odd in a little side"
"street opening on the Embankment, made up her mind with an effort, and,"
"returning by Hungerford Bridge to Waterloo, took a cab to this chosen"
"refuge with her two pieces of luggage. There was just a minute's"
"hesitation before they gave her a room."
"The young lady in the bureau said she would inquire, and Ann Veronica,"
"while she affected to read the appeal on a hospital collecting-box upon"
"the bureau counter, had a disagreeable sense of being surveyed from"
"behind by a small, whiskered gentleman in a frock-coat, who came out of"
"the inner office and into the hall among a number of equally observant"
"green porters to look at her and her bags. But the survey was"
"satisfactory, and she found herself presently in Room No. 47,"
"straightening her hat and waiting for her luggage to appear."
"\"All right so far,\" she said to herself...."
"Part 4"
"But presently, as she sat on the one antimacassared red silk chair"
"and surveyed her hold-all and bag in that tidy, rather vacant, and"
"dehumanized apartment, with its empty wardrobe and desert toilet-table"
"and pictureless walls and stereotyped furnishings, a sudden blankness"
"came upon her as though she didn't matter, and had been thrust away into"
"this impersonal corner, she and her gear...."
"She decided to go out into the London afternoon again and get something"
"to eat in an Aerated Bread shop or some such place, and perhaps find a"
"cheap room for herself. Of course that was what she had to do; she had"
"to find a cheap room for herself and work!"
"This Room No. 47 was no more than a sort of railway compartment on the"
"way to that."
"How does one get work?"
"She walked along the Strand and across Trafalgar Square, and by the"
"Haymarket to Piccadilly, and so through dignified squares and palatial"
"alleys to Oxford Street; and her mind was divided between a speculative"
"treatment of employment on the one hand, and breezes--zephyr breezes--of"
"the keenest appreciation for London, on the other. The jolly part of it"
"was that for the first time in her life so far as London was concerned,"
"she was not going anywhere in particular; for the first time in her life"
"it seemed to her she was taking London in."
"She tried to think how people get work. Ought she to walk into some"
"of these places and tell them what she could do? She hesitated at the"
"window of a shipping-office in Cockspur Street and at the Army and"
"Navy Stores, but decided that perhaps there would be some special and"
"customary hour, and that it would be better for her to find this out"
"before she made her attempt. And, besides, she didn't just immediately"
"want to make her attempt."
"She fell into a pleasant dream of positions and work. Behind every one"
"of these myriad fronts she passed there must be a career or careers. Her"
"ideas of women's employment and a modern woman's pose in life were based"
"largely on the figure of Vivie Warren in Mrs. Warren's Profession. She"
"had seen Mrs. Warren's Profession furtively with Hetty Widgett from the"
"gallery of a Stage Society performance one Monday afternoon. Most of"
"it had been incomprehensible to her, or comprehensible in a way that"
"checked further curiosity, but the figure of Vivien, hard, capable,"
"successful, and bullying, and ordering about a veritable Teddy in the"
"person of Frank Gardner, appealed to her. She saw herself in very much"
"Vivie's position--managing something."
"Her thoughts were deflected from Vivie Warren by the peculiar behavior"
"of a middle-aged gentleman in Piccadilly. He appeared suddenly from"
"the infinite in the neighborhood of the Burlington Arcade, crossing"
"the pavement toward her and with his eyes upon her. He seemed to her"
"indistinguishably about her father's age. He wore a silk hat a little"
"tilted, and a morning coat buttoned round a tight, contained figure;"
"and a white slip gave a finish to his costume and endorsed the quiet"
"distinction of his tie. His face was a little flushed perhaps, and his"
"small, brown eyes were bright. He stopped on the curb-stone, not facing"
"her but as if he was on his way to cross the road, and spoke to her"
"suddenly over his shoulder."
"\"Whither away?\" he said, very distinctly in a curiously wheedling voice."
"Ann Veronica stared at his foolish, propitiatory smile, his hungry gaze,"
"through one moment of amazement, then stepped aside and went on her way"
"with a quickened step. But her mind was ruffled, and its mirror-like"
"surface of satisfaction was not easily restored."
"Queer old gentleman!"
"The art of ignoring is one of the accomplishments of every well-bred"
"girl, so carefully instilled that at last she can even ignore her own"
"thoughts and her own knowledge. Ann Veronica could at the same time ask"
"herself what this queer old gentleman could have meant by speaking to"
"her, and know--know in general terms, at least--what that accosting"
"signified. About her, as she had gone day by day to and from the"
"Tredgold College, she had seen and not seen many an incidental aspect"
"of those sides of life about which girls are expected to know nothing,"
"aspects that were extraordinarily relevant to her own position and"
"outlook on the world, and yet by convention ineffably remote. For all"
"that she was of exceptional intellectual enterprise, she had never"
"yet considered these things with unaverted eyes. She had viewed them"
"askance, and without exchanging ideas with any one else in the world"
"about them."
"She went on her way now no longer dreaming and appreciative, but"
"disturbed and unwillingly observant behind her mask of serene"
"contentment."
"That delightful sense of free, unembarrassed movement was gone."
"As she neared the bottom of the dip in Piccadilly she saw a woman"
"approaching her from the opposite direction--a tall woman who at the"
"first glance seemed altogether beautiful and fine. She came along with"
"the fluttering assurance of some tall ship. Then as she drew nearer"
"paint showed upon her face, and a harsh purpose behind the quiet"
"expression of her open countenance, and a sort of unreality in her"
"splendor betrayed itself for which Ann Veronica could not recall the"
"right word--a word, half understood, that lurked and hid in her mind,"
"the word \"meretricious.\" Behind this woman and a little to the side"
"of her, walked a man smartly dressed, with desire and appraisal in his"
"eyes. Something insisted that those two were mysteriously linked--that"
"the woman knew the man was there."
"It was a second reminder that against her claim to go free and"
"untrammelled there was a case to be made, that after all it was true"
"that a girl does not go alone in the world unchallenged, nor ever has"
"gone freely alone in the world, that evil walks abroad and dangers, and"
"petty insults more irritating than dangers, lurk."
"It was in the quiet streets and squares toward Oxford Street that"
"it first came into her head disagreeably that she herself was being"
"followed. She observed a man walking on the opposite side of the way and"
"looking toward her."
"\"Bother it all!\" she swore. \"Bother!\" and decided that this was not so,"
"and would not look to right or left again."
"Beyond the Circus Ann Veronica went into a British Tea-Table Company"
"shop to get some tea. And as she was yet waiting for her tea to come she"
"saw this man again. Either it was an unfortunate recovery of a trail, or"
"he had followed her from Mayfair. There was no mistaking his intentions"
"this time. He came down the shop looking for her quite obviously, and"
"took up a position on the other side against a mirror in which he was"
"able to regard her steadfastly."
"Beneath the serene unconcern of Ann Veronica's face was a boiling"
"tumult. She was furiously angry. She gazed with a quiet detachment"
"toward the window and the Oxford Street traffic, and in her heart she"
"was busy kicking this man to death. He HAD followed her! What had he"
"followed her for? He must have followed her all the way from beyond"
"Grosvenor Square."
"He was a tall man and fair, with bluish eyes that were rather"
"protuberant, and long white hands of which he made a display. He had"
"removed his silk hat, and now sat looking at Ann Veronica over an"
"untouched cup of tea; he sat gloating upon her, trying to catch her eye."
"Once, when he thought he had done so, he smiled an ingratiating smile."
"He moved, after quiet intervals, with a quick little movement, and ever"
"and again stroked his small mustache and coughed a self-conscious cough."
"\"That he should be in the same world with me!\" said Ann Veronica,"
"reduced to reading the list of good things the British Tea-Table Company"
"had priced for its patrons."
"Heaven knows what dim and tawdry conceptions of passion and desire were"
"in that blond cranium, what romance-begotten dreams of intrigue and"
"adventure! but they sufficed, when presently Ann Veronica went out"
"into the darkling street again, to inspire a flitting, dogged pursuit,"
"idiotic, exasperating, indecent."
"She had no idea what she should do. If she spoke to a policeman she did"
"not know what would ensue. Perhaps she would have to charge this man and"
"appear in a police-court next day."
"She became angry with herself. She would not be driven in by this"
"persistent, sneaking aggression. She would ignore him. Surely she could"
"ignore him. She stopped abruptly, and looked in a flower-shop window. He"
"passed, and came loitering back and stood beside her, silently looking"
"into her face."
"The afternoon had passed now into twilight. The shops were lighting"
"up into gigantic lanterns of color, the street lamps were glowing"
"into existence, and she had lost her way. She had lost her sense of"
"direction, and was among unfamiliar streets. She went on from street to"
"street, and all the glory of London had departed. Against the sinister,"
"the threatening, monstrous inhumanity of the limitless city, there was"
"nothing now but this supreme, ugly fact of a pursuit--the pursuit of the"
"undesired, persistent male."
"For a second time Ann Veronica wanted to swear at the universe."
"There were moments when she thought of turning upon this man and"
"talking to him. But there was something in his face at once stupid and"
"invincible that told her he would go on forcing himself upon her, that"
"he would esteem speech with her a great point gained. In the twilight"
"he had ceased to be a person one could tackle and shame; he had become"
"something more general, a something that crawled and sneaked toward her"
"and would not let her alone...."
"Then, when the tension was getting unendurable, and she was on the verge"
"of speaking to some casual passer-by and demanding help, her follower"
"vanished. For a time she could scarcely believe he was gone. He had. The"
"night had swallowed him up, but his work on her was done. She had lost"
"her nerve, and there was no more freedom in London for her that night."
"She was glad to join in the stream of hurrying homeward workers that was"
"now welling out of a thousand places of employment, and to imitate their"
"driven, preoccupied haste. She had followed a bobbing white hat and gray"
"jacket until she reached the Euston Road corner of Tottenham Court Road,"
"and there, by the name on a bus and the cries of a conductor, she made"
"a guess of her way. And she did not merely affect to be driven--she felt"
"driven. She was afraid people would follow her, she was afraid of the"
"dark, open doorways she passed, and afraid of the blazes of light; she"
"was afraid to be alone, and she knew not what it was she feared."
"It was past seven when she got back to her hotel. She thought then that"
"she had shaken off the man of the bulging blue eyes forever, but that"
"night she found he followed her into her dreams. He stalked her, he"
"stared at her, he craved her, he sidled slinking and propitiatory"
"and yet relentlessly toward her, until at last she awoke from the"
"suffocating nightmare nearness of his approach, and lay awake in fear"
"and horror listening to the unaccustomed sounds of the hotel."
"She came very near that night to resolving that she would return to"
"her home next morning. But the morning brought courage again, and those"
"first intimations of horror vanished completely from her mind."
"Part 5"
"She had sent her father a telegram from the East Strand post-office"
"worded thus:"
"     |   All   |    is     |   well   |   with   |   me    |"
"     |---------|-----------|----------|----------|---------|"
"     |   and   |   quite   |   safe   | Veronica |         |"
"     -----------------------------------------------------"
"and afterward she had dined a la carte upon a cutlet, and had then set"
"herself to write an answer to Mr. Manning's proposal of marriage. But"
"she had found it very difficult."
"\"DEAR MR. MANNING,\" she had begun. So far it had been plain sailing,"
"and it had seemed fairly evident to go on: \"I find it very difficult to"
"answer your letter.\""
"But after that neither ideas nor phrases had come and she had fallen"
"thinking of the events of the day. She had decided that she would spend"
"the next morning answering advertisements in the papers that abounded in"
"the writing-room; and so, after half an hour's perusal of back numbers"
"of the Sketch in the drawing-room, she had gone to bed."
"She found next morning, when she came to this advertisement answering,"
"that it was more difficult than she had supposed. In the first place"
"there were not so many suitable advertisements as she had expected."
"She sat down by the paper-rack with a general feeling of resemblance"
"to Vivie Warren, and looked through the Morning Post and Standard and"
"Telegraph, and afterward the half-penny sheets. The Morning Post was"
"hungry for governesses and nursery governesses, but held out no other"
"hopes; the Daily Telegraph that morning seemed eager only for skirt"
"hands. She went to a writing-desk and made some memoranda on a sheet of"
"note-paper, and then remembered that she had no address as yet to which"
"letters could be sent."
"She decided to leave this matter until the morrow and devote the morning"
"to settling up with Mr. Manning. At the cost of quite a number of torn"
"drafts she succeeded in evolving this:"
"\"DEAR MR. MANNING,--I find it very difficult to answer your letter."
"I hope you won't mind if I say first that I think it does me an"
"extraordinary honor that you should think of any one like myself"
"so highly and seriously, and, secondly, that I wish it had not been"
"written.\""
"She surveyed this sentence for some time before going on. \"I wonder,\""
"she said, \"why one writes him sentences like that? It'll have to go,\""
"she decided, \"I've written too many already.\" She went on, with a"
"desperate attempt to be easy and colloquial:"
"\"You see, we were rather good friends, I thought, and now perhaps it"
"will be difficult for us to get back to the old friendly footing. But if"
"that can possibly be done I want it to be done. You see, the plain fact"
"of the case is that I think I am too young and ignorant for marriage."
"I have been thinking these things over lately, and it seems to me that"
"marriage for a girl is just the supremest thing in life. It isn't just"
"one among a number of important things; for her it is the important"
"thing, and until she knows far more than I know of the facts of life,"
"how is she to undertake it? So please; if you will, forget that you"
"wrote that letter, and forgive this answer. I want you to think of me"
"just as if I was a man, and quite outside marriage altogether."
"\"I do hope you will be able to do this, because I value men friends."
"I shall be very sorry if I cannot have you for a friend. I think that"
"there is no better friend for a girl than a man rather older than"
"herself."
"\"Perhaps by this time you will have heard of the step I have taken in"
"leaving my home. Very likely you will disapprove highly of what I have"
"done--I wonder? You may, perhaps, think I have done it just in a fit of"
"childish petulance because my father locked me in when I wanted to go"
"to a ball of which he did not approve. But really it is much more"
"than that. At Morningside Park I feel as though all my growing up was"
"presently to stop, as though I was being shut in from the light of life,"
"and, as they say in botany, etiolated. I was just like a sort of dummy"
"that does things as it is told--that is to say, as the strings are"
"pulled. I want to be a person by myself, and to pull my own strings. I"
"had rather have trouble and hardship like that than be taken care of by"
"others. I want to be myself. I wonder if a man can quite understand that"
"passionate feeling? It is quite a passionate feeling. So I am already"
"no longer the girl you knew at Morningside Park. I am a young person"
"seeking employment and freedom and self-development, just as in quite"
"our first talk of all I said I wanted to be."
"\"I do hope you will see how things are, and not be offended with me or"
"frightfully shocked and distressed by what I have done."
"\"Very sincerely yours,"
"\"ANN VERONICA STANLEY.\""
"Part 6"
"In the afternoon she resumed her search for apartments. The intoxicating"
"sense of novelty had given place to a more business-like mood. She"
"drifted northward from the Strand, and came on some queer and dingy"
"quarters."
"She had never imagined life was half so sinister as it looked to her in"
"the beginning of these investigations. She found herself again in the"
"presence of some element in life about which she had been trained not"
"to think, about which she was perhaps instinctively indisposed to think;"
"something which jarred, in spite of all her mental resistance, with"
"all her preconceptions of a clean and courageous girl walking out from"
"Morningside Park as one walks out of a cell into a free and spacious"
"world. One or two landladies refused her with an air of conscious virtue"
"that she found hard to explain. \"We don't let to ladies,\" they said."
"She drifted, via Theobald's Road, obliquely toward the region about"
"Titchfield Street. Such apartments as she saw were either scandalously"
"dirty or unaccountably dear, or both. And some were adorned with"
"engravings that struck her as being more vulgar and undesirable than"
"anything she had ever seen in her life. Ann Veronica loved beautiful"
"things, and the beauty of undraped loveliness not least among them; but"
"these were pictures that did but insist coarsely upon the roundness of"
"women's bodies. The windows of these rooms were obscured with draperies,"
"their floors a carpet patchwork; the china ornaments on their mantels"
"were of a class apart. After the first onset several of the women who"
"had apartments to let said she would not do for them, and in effect"
"dismissed her. This also struck her as odd."
"About many of these houses hung a mysterious taint as of something"
"weakly and commonly and dustily evil; the women who negotiated the rooms"
"looked out through a friendly manner as though it was a mask, with hard,"
"defiant eyes. Then one old crone, short-sighted and shaky-handed, called"
"Ann Veronica \"dearie,\" and made some remark, obscure and slangy, of"
"which the spirit rather than the words penetrated to her understanding."
"For a time she looked at no more apartments, and walked through"
"gaunt and ill-cleaned streets, through the sordid under side of life,"
"perplexed and troubled, ashamed of her previous obtuseness."
"She had something of the feeling a Hindoo must experience who has been"
"into surroundings or touched something that offends his caste. She"
"passed people in the streets and regarded them with a quickening"
"apprehension, once or twice came girls dressed in slatternly finery,"
"going toward Regent Street from out these places. It did not occur to"
"her that they at least had found a way of earning a living, and had that"
"much economic superiority to herself. It did not occur to her that save"
"for some accidents of education and character they had souls like her"
"own."
"For a time Ann Veronica went on her way gauging the quality of sordid"
"streets. At last, a little way to the northward of Euston Road, the"
"moral cloud seemed to lift, the moral atmosphere to change; clean blinds"
"appeared in the windows, clean doorsteps before the doors, a different"
"appeal in the neatly placed cards bearing the word"
"     --------------------------"
"     |        APARTMENTS        |"
"     --------------------------"
"in the clear bright windows. At last in a street near the Hampstead Road"
"she hit upon a room that had an exceptional quality of space and order,"
"and a tall woman with a kindly face to show it. \"You're a student,"
"perhaps?\" said the tall woman. \"At the Tredgold Women's College,\" said"
"Ann Veronica. She felt it would save explanations if she did not state"
"she had left her home and was looking for employment. The room was"
"papered with green, large-patterned paper that was at worst a trifle"
"dingy, and the arm-chair and the seats of the other chairs were covered"
"with the unusual brightness of a large-patterned chintz, which also"
"supplied the window-curtain. There was a round table covered, not with"
"the usual \"tapestry\" cover, but with a plain green cloth that went"
"passably with the wall-paper. In the recess beside the fireplace"
"were some open bookshelves. The carpet was a quiet drugget and not"
"excessively worn, and the bed in the corner was covered by a white"
"quilt. There were neither texts nor rubbish on the walls, but only a"
"stirring version of Belshazzar's feast, a steel engraving in the early"
"Victorian manner that had some satisfactory blacks. And the woman who"
"showed this room was tall, with an understanding eye and the quiet"
"manner of the well-trained servant."
"Ann Veronica brought her luggage in a cab from the hotel; she tipped the"
"hotel porter sixpence and overpaid the cabman eighteenpence, unpacked"
"some of her books and possessions, and so made the room a little"
"homelike, and then sat down in a by no means uncomfortable arm-chair"
"before the fire. She had arranged for a supper of tea, a boiled egg, and"
"some tinned peaches. She had discussed the general question of supplies"
"with the helpful landlady. \"And now,\" said Ann Veronica surveying her"
"apartment with an unprecedented sense of proprietorship, \"what is the"
"next step?\""
"She spent the evening in writing--it was a little difficult--to her"
"father and--which was easier--to the Widgetts. She was greatly heartened"
"by doing this. The necessity of defending herself and assuming a"
"confident and secure tone did much to dispell the sense of being"
"exposed and indefensible in a huge dingy world that abounded in sinister"
"possibilities. She addressed her letters, meditated on them for a time,"
"and then took them out and posted them. Afterward she wanted to get her"
"letter to her father back in order to read it over again, and, if it"
"tallied with her general impression of it, re-write it."
"He would know her address to-morrow. She reflected upon that with a"
"thrill of terror that was also, somehow, in some faint remote way,"
"gleeful."
"\"Dear old Daddy,\" she said, \"he'll make a fearful fuss. Well, it had to"
"happen somewhen.... Somehow. I wonder what he'll say?\""
"CHAPTER THE SIXTH"
"EXPOSTULATIONS"
"Part 1"
"The next morning opened calmly, and Ann Veronica sat in her own room,"
"her very own room, and consumed an egg and marmalade, and read the"
"advertisements in the Daily Telegraph. Then began expostulations,"
"preluded by a telegram and headed by her aunt. The telegram reminded"
"Ann Veronica that she had no place for interviews except her"
"bed-sitting-room, and she sought her landlady and negotiated hastily for"
"the use of the ground floor parlor, which very fortunately was vacant."
"She explained she was expecting an important interview, and asked that"
"her visitor should be duly shown in. Her aunt arrived about half-past"
"ten, in black and with an unusually thick spotted veil. She raised this"
"with the air of a conspirator unmasking, and displayed a tear-flushed"
"face. For a moment she remained silent."
"\"My dear,\" she said, when she could get her breath, \"you must come home"
"at once.\""
"Ann Veronica closed the door quite softly and stood still."
"\"This has almost killed your father.... After Gwen!\""
"\"I sent a telegram.\""
"\"He cares so much for you. He did so care for you.\""
"\"I sent a telegram to say I was all right.\""
"\"All right! And I never dreamed anything of the sort was going on. I"
"had no idea!\" She sat down abruptly and threw her wrists limply upon the"
"table. \"Oh, Veronica!\" she said, \"to leave your home!\""
"She had been weeping. She was weeping now. Ann Veronica was overcome by"
"this amount of emotion."
"\"Why did you do it?\" her aunt urged. \"Why could you not confide in us?\""
"\"Do what?\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"What you have done.\""
"\"But what have I done?\""
"\"Elope! Go off in this way. We had no idea. We had such a pride in"
"you, such hope in you. I had no idea you were not the happiest girl."
"Everything I could do! Your father sat up all night. Until at last I"
"persuaded him to go to bed. He wanted to put on his overcoat and come"
"after you and look for you--in London. We made sure it was just like"
"Gwen. Only Gwen left a letter on the pincushion. You didn't even do that"
"Vee; not even that.\""
"\"I sent a telegram, aunt,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"Like a stab. You didn't even put the twelve words.\""
"\"I said I was all right.\""
"\"Gwen said she was happy. Before that came your father didn't even"
"know you were gone. He was just getting cross about your being late for"
"dinner--you know his way--when it came. He opened it--just off-hand, and"
"then when he saw what it was he hit at the table and sent his soup spoon"
"flying and splashing on to the tablecloth. 'My God!' he said, 'I'll go"
"after them and kill him. I'll go after them and kill him.' For the"
"moment I thought it was a telegram from Gwen.\""
"\"But what did father imagine?\""
"\"Of course he imagined! Any one would! 'What has happened, Peter?' I"
"asked. He was standing up with the telegram crumpled in his hand. He"
"used a most awful word! Then he said, 'It's Ann Veronica gone to join"
"her sister!' 'Gone!' I said. 'Gone!' he said. 'Read that,' and threw the"
"telegram at me, so that it went into the tureen. He swore when I tried"
"to get it out with the ladle, and told me what it said. Then he sat"
"down again in a chair and said that people who wrote novels ought to be"
"strung up. It was as much as I could do to prevent him flying out of the"
"house there and then and coming after you. Never since I was a girl have"
"I seen your father so moved. 'Oh! little Vee!' he cried, 'little Vee!'"
"and put his face between his hands and sat still for a long time before"
"he broke out again.\""
"Ann Veronica had remained standing while her aunt spoke."
"\"Do you mean, aunt,\" she asked, \"that my father thought I had gone"
"off--with some man?\""
"\"What else COULD he think? Would any one DREAM you would be so mad as to"
"go off alone?\""
"\"After--after what had happened the night before?\""
"\"Oh, why raise up old scores? If you could see him this morning, his"
"poor face as white as a sheet and all cut about with shaving! He was"
"for coming up by the very first train and looking for you, but I said to"
"him, 'Wait for the letters,' and there, sure enough, was yours. He could"
"hardly open the envelope, he trembled so. Then he threw the letter at"
"me. 'Go and fetch her home,' he said; 'it isn't what we thought! It's"
"just a practical joke of hers.' And with that he went off to the City,"
"stern and silent, leaving his bacon on his plate--a great slice of bacon"
"hardly touched. No breakfast, he's had no dinner, hardly a mouthful of"
"soup--since yesterday at tea.\""
"She stopped. Aunt and niece regarded each other silently."
"\"You must come home to him at once,\" said Miss Stanley."
"Ann Veronica looked down at her fingers on the claret-colored"
"table-cloth. Her aunt had summoned up an altogether too vivid picture"
"of her father as the masterful man, overbearing, emphatic, sentimental,"
"noisy, aimless. Why on earth couldn't he leave her to grow in her own"
"way? Her pride rose at the bare thought of return."
"\"I don't think I CAN do that,\" she said. She looked up and said, a"
"little breathlessly, \"I'm sorry, aunt, but I don't think I can.\""
"Part 2"
"Then it was the expostulations really began."
"From first to last, on this occasion, her aunt expostulated for about"
"two hours. \"But, my dear,\" she began, \"it is Impossible! It is quite out"
"of the Question. You simply can't.\" And to that, through vast rhetorical"
"meanderings, she clung. It reached her only slowly that Ann Veronica was"
"standing to her resolution. \"How will you live?\" she appealed. \"Think"
"of what people will say!\" That became a refrain. \"Think of what Lady"
"Palsworthy will say! Think of what\"--So-and-so--\"will say! What are we"
"to tell people?"
"\"Besides, what am I to tell your father?\""
"At first it had not been at all clear to Ann Veronica that she would"
"refuse to return home; she had had some dream of a capitulation that"
"should leave her an enlarged and defined freedom, but as her aunt put"
"this aspect and that of her flight to her, as she wandered illogically"
"and inconsistently from one urgent consideration to another, as she"
"mingled assurances and aspects and emotions, it became clearer and"
"clearer to the girl that there could be little or no change in the"
"position of things if she returned. \"And what will Mr. Manning think?\""
"said her aunt."
"\"I don't care what any one thinks,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"I can't imagine what has come over you,\" said her aunt. \"I can't"
"conceive what you want. You foolish girl!\""
"Ann Veronica took that in silence. At the back of her mind, dim and yet"
"disconcerting, was the perception that she herself did not know what she"
"wanted. And yet she knew it was not fair to call her a foolish girl."
"\"Don't you care for Mr. Manning?\" said her aunt."
"\"I don't see what he has to do with my coming to London?\""
"\"He--he worships the ground you tread on. You don't deserve it, but he"
"does. Or at least he did the day before yesterday. And here you are!\""
"Her aunt opened all the fingers of her gloved hand in a rhetorical"
"gesture. \"It seems to me all madness--madness! Just because your"
"father--wouldn't let you disobey him!\""
"Part 3"
"In the afternoon the task of expostulation was taken up by Mr. Stanley"
"in person. Her father's ideas of expostulation were a little harsh and"
"forcible, and over the claret-colored table-cloth and under the gas"
"chandelier, with his hat and umbrella between them like the mace in"
"Parliament, he and his daughter contrived to have a violent quarrel. She"
"had intended to be quietly dignified, but he was in a smouldering rage"
"from the beginning, and began by assuming, which alone was more than"
"flesh and blood could stand, that the insurrection was over and that she"
"was coming home submissively. In his desire to be emphatic and to avenge"
"himself for his over-night distresses, he speedily became brutal, more"
"brutal than she had ever known him before."
"\"A nice time of anxiety you've given me, young lady,\" he said, as he"
"entered the room. \"I hope you're satisfied.\""
"She was frightened--his anger always did frighten her--and in her"
"resolve to conceal her fright she carried a queen-like dignity to what"
"she felt even at the time was a preposterous pitch. She said she hoped"
"she had not distressed him by the course she had felt obliged to take,"
"and he told her not to be a fool. She tried to keep her side up by"
"declaring that he had put her into an impossible position, and he"
"replied by shouting, \"Nonsense! Nonsense! Any father in my place would"
"have done what I did.\""
"Then he went on to say: \"Well, you've had your little adventure, and I"
"hope now you've had enough of it. So go up-stairs and get your things"
"together while I look out for a hansom.\""
"To which the only possible reply seemed to be, \"I'm not coming home.\""
"\"Not coming home!\""
"\"No!\" And, in spite of her resolve to be a Person, Ann Veronica began"
"to weep with terror at herself. Apparently she was always doomed to weep"
"when she talked to her father. But he was always forcing her to say and"
"do such unexpectedly conclusive things. She feared he might take her"
"tears as a sign of weakness. So she said: \"I won't come home. I'd rather"
"starve!\""
"For a moment the conversation hung upon that declaration. Then Mr."
"Stanley, putting his hands on the table in the manner rather of a"
"barrister than a solicitor, and regarding her balefully through his"
"glasses with quite undisguised animosity, asked, \"And may I presume to"
"inquire, then, what you mean to do?--how do you propose to live?\""
"\"I shall live,\" sobbed Ann Veronica. \"You needn't be anxious about that!"
"I shall contrive to live.\""
"\"But I AM anxious,\" said Mr. Stanley, \"I am anxious. Do you think it's"
"nothing to me to have my daughter running about London looking for odd"
"jobs and disgracing herself?\""
"\"Sha'n't get odd jobs,\" said Ann Veronica, wiping her eyes."
"And from that point they went on to a thoroughly embittering wrangle."
"Mr. Stanley used his authority, and commanded Ann Veronica to come home,"
"to which, of course, she said she wouldn't; and then he warned her not"
"to defy him, warned her very solemnly, and then commanded her again."
"He then said that if she would not obey him in this course she should"
"\"never darken his doors again,\" and was, indeed, frightfully abusive."
"This threat terrified Ann Veronica so much that she declared with sobs"
"and vehemence that she would never come home again, and for a time both"
"talked at once and very wildly. He asked her whether she understood what"
"she was saying, and went on to say still more precisely that she should"
"never touch a penny of his money until she came home again--not one"
"penny. Ann Veronica said she didn't care."
"Then abruptly Mr. Stanley changed his key. \"You poor child!\" he said;"
"\"don't you see the infinite folly of these proceedings? Think! Think of"
"the love and affection you abandon! Think of your aunt, a second mother"
"to you. Think if your own mother was alive!\""
"He paused, deeply moved."
"\"If my own mother was alive,\" sobbed Ann Veronica, \"she would"
"understand.\""
"The talk became more and more inconclusive and exhausting. Ann Veronica"
"found herself incompetent, undignified, and detestable, holding on"
"desperately to a hardening antagonism to her father, quarrelling with"
"him, wrangling with him, thinking of repartees--almost as if he was a"
"brother. It was horrible, but what could she do? She meant to live"
"her own life, and he meant, with contempt and insults, to prevent her."
"Anything else that was said she now regarded only as an aspect of or"
"diversion from that."
"In the retrospect she was amazed to think how things had gone to pieces,"
"for at the outset she had been quite prepared to go home again upon"
"terms. While waiting for his coming she had stated her present"
"and future relations with him with what had seemed to her the most"
"satisfactory lucidity and completeness. She had looked forward to an"
"explanation. Instead had come this storm, this shouting, this weeping,"
"this confusion of threats and irrelevant appeals. It was not only that"
"her father had said all sorts of inconsistent and unreasonable things,"
"but that by some incomprehensible infection she herself had replied in"
"the same vein. He had assumed that her leaving home was the point at"
"issue, that everything turned on that, and that the sole alternative was"
"obedience, and she had fallen in with that assumption until rebellion"
"seemed a sacred principle. Moreover, atrociously and inexorably, he"
"allowed it to appear ever and again in horrible gleams that he suspected"
"there was some man in the case.... Some man!"
"And to conclude it all was the figure of her father in the doorway,"
"giving her a last chance, his hat in one hand, his umbrella in the"
"other, shaken at her to emphasize his point."
"\"You understand, then,\" he was saying, \"you understand?\""
"\"I understand,\" said Ann Veronica, tear-wet and flushed with a"
"reciprocal passion, but standing up to him with an equality that amazed"
"even herself, \"I understand.\" She controlled a sob. \"Not a penny--not"
"one penny--and never darken your doors again!\""
"Part 4"
"The next day her aunt came again and expostulated, and was just saying"
"it was \"an unheard-of thing\" for a girl to leave her home as Ann"
"Veronica had done, when her father arrived, and was shown in by the"
"pleasant-faced landlady."
"Her father had determined on a new line. He put down his hat and"
"umbrella, rested his hands on his hips, and regarded Ann Veronica"
"firmly."
"\"Now,\" he said, quietly, \"it's time we stopped this nonsense.\""
"Ann Veronica was about to reply, when he went on, with a still more"
"deadly quiet: \"I am not here to bandy words with you. Let us have no"
"more of this humbug. You are to come home.\""
"\"I thought I explained--\""
"\"I don't think you can have heard me,\" said her father; \"I have told you"
"to come home.\""
"\"I thought I explained--\""
"\"Come home!\""
"Ann Veronica shrugged her shoulders."
"\"Very well,\" said her father."
"\"I think this ends the business,\" he said, turning to his sister."
"\"It's not for us to supplicate any more. She must learn wisdom--as God"
"pleases.\""
"\"But, my dear Peter!\" said Miss Stanley."
"\"No,\" said her brother, conclusively, \"it's not for a parent to go on"
"persuading a child.\""
"Miss Stanley rose and regarded Ann Veronica fixedly. The girl stood with"
"her hands behind her back, sulky, resolute, and intelligent, a strand"
"of her black hair over one eye and looking more than usually"
"delicate-featured, and more than ever like an obdurate child."
"\"She doesn't know.\""
"\"She does.\""
"\"I can't imagine what makes you fly out against everything like this,\""
"said Miss Stanley to her niece."
"\"What is the good of talking?\" said her brother. \"She must go her own"
"way. A man's children nowadays are not his own. That's the fact of the"
"matter. Their minds are turned against him.... Rubbishy novels and"
"pernicious rascals. We can't even protect them from themselves.\""
"An immense gulf seemed to open between father and daughter as he said"
"these words."
"\"I don't see,\" gasped Ann Veronica, \"why parents and children..."
"shouldn't be friends.\""
"\"Friends!\" said her father. \"When we see you going through disobedience"
"to the devil! Come, Molly, she must go her own way. I've tried to use my"
"authority. And she defies me. What more is there to be said? She defies"
"me!\""
"It was extraordinary. Ann Veronica felt suddenly an effect of tremendous"
"pathos; she would have given anything to have been able to frame and"
"make some appeal, some utterance that should bridge this bottomless"
"chasm that had opened between her and her father, and she could find"
"nothing whatever to say that was in the least sincere and appealing."
"\"Father,\" she cried, \"I have to live!\""
"He misunderstood her. \"That,\" he said, grimly, with his hand on the"
"door-handle, \"must be your own affair, unless you choose to live at"
"Morningside Park.\""
"Miss Stanley turned to her. \"Vee,\" she said, \"come home. Before it is"
"too late.\""
"\"Come, Molly,\" said Mr. Stanley, at the door."
"\"Vee!\" said Miss Stanley, \"you hear what your father says!\""
"Miss Stanley struggled with emotion. She made a curious movement toward"
"her niece, then suddenly, convulsively, she dabbed down something lumpy"
"on the table and turned to follow her brother. Ann Veronica stared for a"
"moment in amazement at this dark-green object that clashed as it was"
"put down. It was a purse. She made a step forward. \"Aunt!\" she said, \"I"
"can't--\""
"Then she caught a wild appeal in her aunt's blue eye, halted, and the"
"door clicked upon them."
"There was a pause, and then the front door slammed...."
"Ann Veronica realized that she was alone with the world. And this time"
"the departure had a tremendous effect of finality. She had to resist an"
"impulse of sheer terror, to run out after them and give in."
"\"Gods,\" she said, at last, \"I've done it this time!\""
"\"Well!\" She took up the neat morocco purse, opened it, and examined the"
"contents."
"It contained three sovereigns, six and fourpence, two postage stamps, a"
"small key, and her aunt's return half ticket to Morningside Park."
"Part 5"
"After the interview Ann Veronica considered herself formally cut off"
"from home. If nothing else had clinched that, the purse had."
"Nevertheless there came a residuum of expostulations. Her brother Roddy,"
"who was in the motor line, came to expostulate; her sister Alice wrote."
"And Mr. Manning called."
"Her sister Alice seemed to have developed a religious sense away there"
"in Yorkshire, and made appeals that had no meaning for Ann Veronica's"
"mind. She exhorted Ann Veronica not to become one of \"those unsexed"
"intellectuals, neither man nor woman.\""
"Ann Veronica meditated over that phrase. \"That's HIM,\" said Ann"
"Veronica, in sound, idiomatic English. \"Poor old Alice!\""
"Her brother Roddy came to her and demanded tea, and asked her to state"
"a case. \"Bit thick on the old man, isn't it?\" said Roddy, who had"
"developed a bluff, straightforward style in the motor shop."
"\"Mind my smoking?\" said Roddy. \"I don't see quite what your game is,"
"Vee, but I suppose you've got a game on somewhere."
"\"Rummy lot we are!\" said Roddy. \"Alice--Alice gone dotty, and all over"
"kids. Gwen--I saw Gwen the other day, and the paint's thicker than ever."
"Jim is up to the neck in Mahatmas and Theosophy and Higher Thought and"
"rot--writes letters worse than Alice. And now YOU'RE on the war-path. I"
"believe I'm the only sane member of the family left. The G.V.'s as mad"
"as any of you, in spite of all his respectability; not a bit of him"
"straight anywhere, not one bit.\""
"\"Straight?\""
"\"Not a bit of it! He's been out after eight per cent. since the"
"beginning. Eight per cent.! He'll come a cropper one of these days,"
"if you ask me. He's been near it once or twice already. That's got his"
"nerves to rags. I suppose we're all human beings really, but what price"
"the sacred Institution of the Family! Us as a bundle! Eh?... I don't"
"half disagree with you, Vee, really; only thing is, I don't see"
"how you're going to pull it off. A home MAY be a sort of cage, but"
"still--it's a home. Gives you a right to hang on to the old man until he"
"busts--practically. Jolly hard life for a girl, getting a living. Not MY"
"affair.\""
"He asked questions and listened to her views for a time."
"\"I'd chuck this lark right off if I were you, Vee,\" he said. \"I'm five"
"years older than you, and no end wiser, being a man. What you're after"
"is too risky. It's a damned hard thing to do. It's all very handsome"
"starting out on your own, but it's too damned hard. That's my opinion,"
"if you ask me. There's nothing a girl can do that isn't sweated to the"
"bone. You square the G.V., and go home before you have to. That's my"
"advice. If you don't eat humble-pie now you may live to fare worse"
"later. _I_ can't help you a cent. Life's hard enough nowadays for an"
"unprotected male. Let alone a girl. You got to take the world as it is,"
"and the only possible trade for a girl that isn't sweated is to get hold"
"of a man and make him do it for her. It's no good flying out at that,"
"Vee; _I_ didn't arrange it. It's Providence. That's how things are;"
"that's the order of the world. Like appendicitis. It isn't pretty, but"
"we're made so. Rot, no doubt; but we can't alter it. You go home and"
"live on the G.V., and get some other man to live on as soon as possible."
"It isn't sentiment but it's horse sense. All this Woman-who-Diddery--no"
"damn good. After all, old P.--Providence, I mean--HAS arranged it so"
"that men will keep you, more or less. He made the universe on those"
"lines. You've got to take what you can get.\""
"That was the quintessence of her brother Roddy."
"He played variations on this theme for the better part of an hour."
"\"You go home,\" he said, at parting; \"you go home. It's all very fine and"
"all that, Vee, this freedom, but it isn't going to work. The world isn't"
"ready for girls to start out on their own yet; that's the plain fact of"
"the case. Babies and females have got to keep hold of somebody or go"
"under--anyhow, for the next few generations. You go home and wait a"
"century, Vee, and then try again. Then you may have a bit of a chance."
"Now you haven't the ghost of one--not if you play the game fair.\""
"Part 6"
"It was remarkable to Ann Veronica how completely Mr. Manning, in his"
"entirely different dialect, indorsed her brother Roddy's view of things."
"He came along, he said, just to call, with large, loud apologies,"
"radiantly kind and good. Miss Stanley, it was manifest, had given him"
"Ann Veronica's address. The kindly faced landlady had failed to catch"
"his name, and said he was a tall, handsome gentleman with a great black"
"mustache. Ann Veronica, with a sigh at the cost of hospitality, made a"
"hasty negotiation for an extra tea and for a fire in the ground-floor"
"apartment, and preened herself carefully for the interview. In the"
"little apartment, under the gas chandelier, his inches and his stoop"
"were certainly very effective. In the bad light he looked at once"
"military and sentimental and studious, like one of Ouida's guardsmen"
"revised by Mr. Haldane and the London School of Economics and finished"
"in the Keltic school."
"\"It's unforgivable of me to call, Miss Stanley,\" he said, shaking hands"
"in a peculiar, high, fashionable manner; \"but you know you said we might"
"be friends.\""
"\"It's dreadful for you to be here,\" he said, indicating the yellow"
"presence of the first fog of the year without, \"but your aunt told me"
"something of what had happened. It's just like your Splendid Pride to do"
"it. Quite!\""
"He sat in the arm-chair and took tea, and consumed several of the"
"extra cakes which she had sent out for and talked to her and expressed"
"himself, looking very earnestly at her with his deep-set eyes, and"
"carefully avoiding any crumbs on his mustache the while. Ann Veronica"
"sat firelit by her tea-tray with, quite unconsciously, the air of an"
"expert hostess."
"\"But how is it all going to end?\" said Mr. Manning."
"\"Your father, of course,\" he said, \"must come to realize just how"
"Splendid you are! He doesn't understand. I've seen him, and he doesn't"
"a bit understand. _I_ didn't understand before that letter. It makes me"
"want to be just everything I CAN be to you. You're like some splendid"
"Princess in Exile in these Dreadful Dingy apartments!\""
"\"I'm afraid I'm anything but a Princess when it comes to earning a"
"salary,\" said Ann Veronica. \"But frankly, I mean to fight this through"
"if I possibly can.\""
"\"My God!\" said Manning, in a stage-aside. \"Earning a salary!\""
"\"You're like a Princess in Exile!\" he repeated, overruling her. \"You"
"come into these sordid surroundings--you mustn't mind my calling them"
"sordid--and it makes them seem as though they didn't matter.... I"
"don't think they do matter. I don't think any surroundings could throw a"
"shadow on you.\""
"Ann Veronica felt a slight embarrassment. \"Won't you have some more tea,"
"Mr. Manning?\" she asked."
"\"You know--,\" said Mr. Manning, relinquishing his cup without answering"
"her question, \"when I hear you talk of earning a living, it's as if I"
"heard of an archangel going on the Stock Exchange--or Christ selling"
"doves.... Forgive my daring. I couldn't help the thought.\""
"\"It's a very good image,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"I knew you wouldn't mind.\""
"\"But does it correspond with the facts of the case? You know, Mr."
"Manning, all this sort of thing is very well as sentiment, but does it"
"correspond with the realities? Are women truly such angelic things and"
"men so chivalrous? You men have, I know, meant to make us Queens and"
"Goddesses, but in practice--well, look, for example, at the stream of"
"girls one meets going to work of a morning, round-shouldered, cheap, and"
"underfed! They aren't queens, and no one is treating them as queens."
"And look, again, at the women one finds letting lodgings.... I was"
"looking for rooms last week. It got on my nerves--the women I saw. Worse"
"than any man. Everywhere I went and rapped at a door I found behind it"
"another dreadful dingy woman--another fallen queen, I suppose--dingier"
"than the last, dirty, you know, in grain. Their poor hands!\""
"\"I know,\" said Mr. Manning, with entirely suitable emotion."
"\"And think of the ordinary wives and mothers, with their anxiety, their"
"limitations, their swarms of children!\""
"Mr. Manning displayed distress. He fended these things off from him with"
"the rump of his fourth piece of cake. \"I know that our social order is"
"dreadful enough,\" he said, \"and sacrifices all that is best and most"
"beautiful in life. I don't defend it.\""
"\"And besides, when it comes to the idea of queens,\" Ann Veronica went"
"on, \"there's twenty-one and a half million women to twenty million men."
"Suppose our proper place is a shrine. Still, that leaves over a million"
"shrines short, not reckoning widows who re-marry. And more boys die than"
"girls, so that the real disproportion among adults is even greater.\""
"\"I know,\" said Mr Manning, \"I know these Dreadful Statistics. I know"
"there's a sort of right in your impatience at the slowness of Progress."
"But tell me one thing I don't understand--tell me one thing: How can you"
"help it by coming down into the battle and the mire? That's the thing"
"that concerns me.\""
"\"Oh, I'm not trying to help it,\" said Ann Veronica. \"I'm only arguing"
"against your position of what a woman should be, and trying to get"
"it clear in my own mind. I'm in this apartment and looking for work"
"because--Well, what else can I do, when my father practically locks me"
"up?\""
"\"I know,\" said Mr. Manning, \"I know. Don't think I can't sympathize and"
"understand. Still, here we are in this dingy, foggy city. Ye gods! what"
"a wilderness it is! Every one trying to get the better of every one,"
"every one regardless of every one--it's one of those days when every one"
"bumps against you--every one pouring coal smoke into the air and making"
"confusion worse confounded, motor omnibuses clattering and smelling,"
"a horse down in the Tottenham Court Road, an old woman at the corner"
"coughing dreadfully--all the painful sights of a great city, and here"
"you come into it to take your chances. It's too valiant, Miss Stanley,"
"too valiant altogether!\""
"Ann Veronica meditated. She had had two days of employment-seeking now."
"\"I wonder if it is.\""
"\"It isn't,\" said Mr. Manning, \"that I mind Courage in a Woman--I love"
"and admire Courage. What could be more splendid than a beautiful girl"
"facing a great, glorious tiger? Una and the Lion again, and all that!"
"But this isn't that sort of thing; this is just a great, ugly, endless"
"wilderness of selfish, sweating, vulgar competition!\""
"\"That you want to keep me out of?\""
"\"Exactly!\" said Mr. Manning."
"\"In a sort of beautiful garden-close--wearing lovely dresses and picking"
"beautiful flowers?\""
"\"Ah! If one could!\""
"\"While those other girls trudge to business and those other women let"
"lodgings. And in reality even that magic garden-close resolves itself"
"into a villa at Morningside Park and my father being more and more"
"cross and overbearing at meals--and a general feeling of insecurity and"
"futility.\""
"Mr. Manning relinquished his cup, and looked meaningly at Ann Veronica."
"\"There,\" he said, \"you don't treat me fairly, Miss Stanley. My"
"garden-close would be a better thing than that.\""
"CHAPTER THE SEVENTH"
"IDEALS AND A REALITY"
"Part 1"
"And now for some weeks Ann Veronica was to test her market value in the"
"world. She went about in a negligent November London that had become"
"very dark and foggy and greasy and forbidding indeed, and tried to find"
"that modest but independent employment she had so rashly assumed. She"
"went about, intent-looking and self-possessed, trim and fine, concealing"
"her emotions whatever they were, as the realities of her position opened"
"out before her. Her little bed-sitting-room was like a lair, and she"
"went out from it into this vast, dun world, with its smoke-gray houses,"
"its glaring streets of shops, its dark streets of homes, its orange-lit"
"windows, under skies of dull copper or muddy gray or black, much as an"
"animal goes out to seek food. She would come back and write letters,"
"carefully planned and written letters, or read some book she had fetched"
"from Mudie's--she had invested a half-guinea with Mudie's--or sit over"
"her fire and think."
"Slowly and reluctantly she came to realize that Vivie Warren was what"
"is called an \"ideal.\" There were no such girls and no such positions. No"
"work that offered was at all of the quality she had vaguely postulated"
"for herself. With such qualifications as she possessed, two chief"
"channels of employment lay open, and neither attracted her, neither"
"seemed really to offer a conclusive escape from that subjection to"
"mankind against which, in the person of her father, she was rebelling."
"One main avenue was for her to become a sort of salaried accessory wife"
"or mother, to be a governess or an assistant schoolmistress, or a very"
"high type of governess-nurse. The other was to go into business--into a"
"photographer's reception-room, for example, or a costumer's or hat-shop."
"The first set of occupations seemed to her to be altogether too domestic"
"and restricted; for the latter she was dreadfully handicapped by her"
"want of experience. And also she didn't like them. She didn't like the"
"shops, she didn't like the other women's faces; she thought the"
"smirking men in frock-coats who dominated these establishments the"
"most intolerable persons she had ever had to face. One called her very"
"distinctly \"My dear!\""
"Two secretarial posts did indeed seem to offer themselves in which, at"
"least, there was no specific exclusion of womanhood; one was under"
"a Radical Member of Parliament, and the other under a Harley Street"
"doctor, and both men declined her proffered services with the utmost"
"civility and admiration and terror. There was also a curious interview"
"at a big hotel with a middle-aged, white-powdered woman, all covered"
"with jewels and reeking of scent, who wanted a Companion. She did not"
"think Ann Veronica would do as her companion."
"And nearly all these things were fearfully ill-paid. They carried no"
"more than bare subsistence wages; and they demanded all her time and"
"energy. She had heard of women journalists, women writers, and so"
"forth; but she was not even admitted to the presence of the editors she"
"demanded to see, and by no means sure that if she had been she could"
"have done any work they might have given her. One day she desisted from"
"her search and went unexpectedly to the Tredgold College. Her place"
"was not filled; she had been simply noted as absent, and she did a"
"comforting day of admirable dissection upon the tortoise. She was so"
"interested, and this was such a relief from the trudging anxiety of her"
"search for work, that she went on for a whole week as if she was still"
"living at home. Then a third secretarial opening occurred and renewed"
"her hopes again: a position as amanuensis--with which some of the"
"lighter duties of a nurse were combined--to an infirm gentleman of means"
"living at Twickenham, and engaged upon a great literary research to"
"prove that the \"Faery Queen\" was really a treatise upon molecular"
"chemistry written in a peculiar and picturesquely handled cipher."
"Part 2"
"Now, while Ann Veronica was taking these soundings in the industrial"
"sea, and measuring herself against the world as it is, she was also"
"making extensive explorations among the ideas and attitudes of a number"
"of human beings who seemed to be largely concerned with the world as it"
"ought to be. She was drawn first by Miss Miniver, and then by her own"
"natural interest, into a curious stratum of people who are busied with"
"dreams of world progress, of great and fundamental changes, of a New Age"
"that is to replace all the stresses and disorders of contemporary life."
"Miss Miniver learned of her flight and got her address from the"
"Widgetts. She arrived about nine o'clock the next evening in a state of"
"tremulous enthusiasm. She followed the landlady half way up-stairs, and"
"called up to Ann Veronica, \"May I come up? It's me! You know--Nettie"
"Miniver!\" She appeared before Ann Veronica could clearly recall who"
"Nettie Miniver might be."
"There was a wild light in her eye, and her straight hair was out"
"demonstrating and suffragetting upon some independent notions of its"
"own. Her fingers were bursting through her gloves, as if to get at once"
"into touch with Ann Veronica. \"You're Glorious!\" said Miss Miniver in"
"tones of rapture, holding a hand in each of hers and peering up into Ann"
"Veronica's face. \"Glorious! You're so calm, dear, and so resolute, so"
"serene!"
"\"It's girls like you who will show them what We are,\" said Miss Miniver;"
"\"girls whose spirits have not been broken!\""
"Ann Veronica sunned herself a little in this warmth."
"\"I was watching you at Morningside Park, dear,\" said Miss Miniver. \"I am"
"getting to watch all women. I thought then perhaps you didn't care, that"
"you were like so many of them. NOW it's just as though you had grown up"
"suddenly.\""
"She stopped, and then suggested: \"I wonder--I should love--if it was"
"anything _I_ said.\""
"She did not wait for Ann Veronica's reply. She seemed to assume that it"
"must certainly be something she had said. \"They all catch on,\" she said."
"\"It spreads like wildfire. This is such a grand time! Such a glorious"
"time! There never was such a time as this! Everything seems so close to"
"fruition, so coming on and leading on! The Insurrection of Women! They"
"spring up everywhere. Tell me all that happened, one sister-woman to"
"another.\""
"She chilled Ann Veronica a little by that last phrase, and yet the"
"magnetism of her fellowship and enthusiasm was very strong; and it was"
"pleasant to be made out a heroine after so much expostulation and so"
"many secret doubts."
"But she did not listen long; she wanted to talk. She sat, crouched"
"together, by the corner of the hearthrug under the bookcase that"
"supported the pig's skull, and looked into the fire and up at Ann"
"Veronica's face, and let herself go. \"Let us put the lamp out,\" she"
"said; \"the flames are ever so much better for talking,\" and Ann Veronica"
"agreed. \"You are coming right out into life--facing it all.\""
"Ann Veronica sat with her chin on her hand, red-lit and saying little,"
"and Miss Miniver discoursed. As she talked, the drift and significance"
"of what she was saying shaped itself slowly to Ann Veronica's"
"apprehension. It presented itself in the likeness of a great, gray, dull"
"world--a brutal, superstitious, confused, and wrong-headed world,"
"that hurt people and limited people unaccountably. In remote times and"
"countries its evil tendencies had expressed themselves in the form of"
"tyrannies, massacres, wars, and what not; but just at present in England"
"they shaped as commercialism and competition, silk hats, suburban"
"morals, the sweating system, and the subjection of women. So far the"
"thing was acceptable enough. But over against the world Miss Miniver"
"assembled a small but energetic minority, the Children of Light--people"
"she described as \"being in the van,\" or \"altogether in the van,\" about"
"whom Ann Veronica's mind was disposed to be more sceptical."
"Everything, Miss Miniver said, was \"working up,\" everything was \"coming"
"on\"--the Higher Thought, the Simple Life, Socialism, Humanitarianism, it"
"was all the same really. She loved to be there, taking part in it all,"
"breathing it, being it. Hitherto in the world's history there had been"
"precursors of this Progress at great intervals, voices that had spoken"
"and ceased, but now it was all coming on together in a rush. She"
"mentioned, with familiar respect, Christ and Buddha and Shelley and"
"Nietzsche and Plato. Pioneers all of them. Such names shone brightly in"
"the darkness, with black spaces of unilluminated emptiness about them,"
"as stars shine in the night; but now--now it was different; now it was"
"dawn--the real dawn."
"\"The women are taking it up,\" said Miss Miniver; \"the women and the"
"common people, all pressing forward, all roused.\""
"Ann Veronica listened with her eyes on the fire."
"\"Everybody is taking it up,\" said Miss Miniver. \"YOU had to come in. You"
"couldn't help it. Something drew you. Something draws everybody. From"
"suburbs, from country towns--everywhere. I see all the Movements. As"
"far as I can, I belong to them all. I keep my finger on the pulse of"
"things.\""
"Ann Veronica said nothing."
"\"The dawn!\" said Miss Miniver, with her glasses reflecting the fire like"
"pools of blood-red flame."
"\"I came to London,\" said Ann Veronica, \"rather because of my own"
"difficulty. I don't know that I understand altogether.\""
"\"Of course you don't,\" said Miss Miniver, gesticulating triumphantly"
"with her thin hand and thinner wrist, and patting Ann Veronica's knee."
"\"Of course you don't. That's the wonder of it. But you will, you"
"will. You must let me take you to things--to meetings and things, to"
"conferences and talks. Then you will begin to see. You will begin to see"
"it all opening out. I am up to the ears in it all--every moment I can"
"spare. I throw up work--everything! I just teach in one school, one good"
"school, three days a week. All the rest--Movements! I can live now on"
"fourpence a day. Think how free that leaves me to follow things up! I"
"must take you everywhere. I must take you to the Suffrage people, and"
"the Tolstoyans, and the Fabians.\""
"\"I have heard of the Fabians,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"It's THE Society!\" said Miss Miniver. \"It's the centre of the"
"intellectuals. Some of the meetings are wonderful! Such earnest,"
"beautiful women! Such deep-browed men!... And to think that there"
"they are making history! There they are putting together the plans of a"
"new world. Almost light-heartedly. There is Shaw, and Webb, and Wilkins"
"the author, and Toomer, and Doctor Tumpany--the most wonderful people!"
"There you see them discussing, deciding, planning! Just think--THEY ARE"
"MAKING A NEW WORLD!\""
"\"But ARE these people going to alter everything?\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"What else can happen?\" asked Miss Miniver, with a little weak gesture"
"at the glow. \"What else can possibly happen--as things are going now?\""
"Part 3"
"Miss Miniver let Ann Veronica into her peculiar levels of the world"
"with so enthusiastic a generosity that it seemed ingratitude to remain"
"critical. Indeed, almost insensibly Ann Veronica became habituated to"
"the peculiar appearance and the peculiar manners of the people \"in the"
"van.\" The shock of their intellectual attitude was over, usage robbed"
"it of the first quaint effect of deliberate unreason. They were in many"
"respects so right; she clung to that, and shirked more and more the"
"paradoxical conviction that they were also somehow, and even in direct"
"relation to that rightness, absurd."
"Very central in Miss Miniver's universe were the Goopes. The Goopes were"
"the oddest little couple conceivable, following a fruitarian career upon"
"an upper floor in Theobald's Road. They were childless and servantless,"
"and they had reduced simple living to the finest of fine arts. Mr."
"Goopes, Ann Veronica gathered, was a mathematical tutor and visited"
"schools, and his wife wrote a weekly column in New Ideas upon vegetarian"
"cookery, vivisection, degeneration, the lacteal secretion, appendicitis,"
"and the Higher Thought generally, and assisted in the management of"
"a fruit shop in the Tottenham Court Road. Their very furniture had"
"mysteriously a high-browed quality, and Mr. Goopes when at home dressed"
"simply in a pajama-shaped suit of canvas sacking tied with brown"
"ribbons, while his wife wore a purple djibbah with a richly"
"embroidered yoke. He was a small, dark, reserved man, with a large"
"inflexible-looking convex forehead, and his wife was very pink and"
"high-spirited, with one of those chins that pass insensibly into a full,"
"strong neck. Once a week, every Saturday, they had a little gathering"
"from nine till the small hours, just talk and perhaps reading aloud and"
"fruitarian refreshments--chestnut sandwiches buttered with nut tose,"
"and so forth--and lemonade and unfermented wine; and to one of these"
"symposia Miss Miniver after a good deal of preliminary solicitude,"
"conducted Ann Veronica."
"She was introduced, perhaps a little too obviously for her taste, as"
"a girl who was standing out against her people, to a gathering that"
"consisted of a very old lady with an extremely wrinkled skin and a deep"
"voice who was wearing what appeared to Ann Veronica's inexperienced"
"eye to be an antimacassar upon her head, a shy, blond young man with a"
"narrow forehead and glasses, two undistinguished women in plain skirts"
"and blouses, and a middle-aged couple, very fat and alike in black, Mr."
"and Mrs. Alderman Dunstable, of the Borough Council of Marylebone."
"These were seated in an imperfect semicircle about a very copper-adorned"
"fireplace, surmounted by a carved wood inscription:"
"\"DO IT NOW.\""
"And to them were presently added a roguish-looking young man, with"
"reddish hair, an orange tie, and a fluffy tweed suit, and others who,"
"in Ann Veronica's memory, in spite of her efforts to recall details,"
"remained obstinately just \"others.\""
"The talk was animated, and remained always brilliant in form even when"
"it ceased to be brilliant in substance. There were moments when Ann"
"Veronica rather more than suspected the chief speakers to be, as"
"school-boys say, showing off at her."
"They talked of a new substitute for dripping in vegetarian cookery that"
"Mrs. Goopes was convinced exercised an exceptionally purifying influence"
"on the mind. And then they talked of Anarchism and Socialism, and"
"whether the former was the exact opposite of the latter or only a higher"
"form. The reddish-haired young man contributed allusions to the Hegelian"
"philosophy that momentarily confused the discussion. Then Alderman"
"Dunstable, who had hitherto been silent, broke out into speech and went"
"off at a tangent, and gave his personal impressions of quite a number"
"of his fellow-councillors. He continued to do this for the rest of the"
"evening intermittently, in and out, among other topics. He addressed"
"himself chiefly to Goopes, and spoke as if in reply to long-sustained"
"inquiries on the part of Goopes into the personnel of the Marylebone"
"Borough Council. \"If you were to ask me,\" he would say, \"I should say"
"Blinders is straight. An ordinary type, of course--\""
"Mrs. Dunstable's contributions to the conversation were entirely in the"
"form of nods; whenever Alderman Dunstable praised or blamed she nodded"
"twice or thrice, according to the requirements of his emphasis. And"
"she seemed always to keep one eye on Ann Veronica's dress. Mrs."
"Goopes disconcerted the Alderman a little by abruptly challenging the"
"roguish-looking young man in the orange tie (who, it seemed, was the"
"assistant editor of New Ideas) upon a critique of Nietzsche and Tolstoy"
"that had appeared in his paper, in which doubts had been cast upon the"
"perfect sincerity of the latter. Everybody seemed greatly concerned"
"about the sincerity of Tolstoy."
"Miss Miniver said that if once she lost her faith in Tolstoy's"
"sincerity, nothing she felt would really matter much any more, and she"
"appealed to Ann Veronica whether she did not feel the same; and Mr."
"Goopes said that we must distinguish between sincerity and irony, which"
"was often indeed no more than sincerity at the sublimated level."
"Alderman Dunstable said that sincerity was often a matter of"
"opportunity, and illustrated the point to the fair young man with an"
"anecdote about Blinders on the Dust Destructor Committee, during which"
"the young man in the orange tie succeeded in giving the whole discussion"
"a daring and erotic flavor by questioning whether any one could be"
"perfectly sincere in love."
"Miss Miniver thought that there was no true sincerity except in love,"
"and appealed to Ann Veronica, but the young man in the orange tie went"
"on to declare that it was quite possible to be sincerely in love with"
"two people at the same time, although perhaps on different planes with"
"each individual, and deceiving them both. But that brought Mrs. Goopes"
"down on him with the lesson Titian teaches so beautifully in his \"Sacred"
"and Profane Love,\" and became quite eloquent upon the impossibility of"
"any deception in the former."
"Then they discoursed on love for a time, and Alderman Dunstable, turning"
"back to the shy, blond young man and speaking in undertones of the"
"utmost clearness, gave a brief and confidential account of an unfounded"
"rumor of the bifurcation of the affections of Blinders that had led to a"
"situation of some unpleasantness upon the Borough Council."
"The very old lady in the antimacassar touched Ann Veronica's arm"
"suddenly, and said, in a deep, arch voice:"
"\"Talking of love again; spring again, love again. Oh! you young people!\""
"The young man with the orange tie, in spite of Sisyphus-like efforts"
"on the part of Goopes to get the topic on to a higher plane, displayed"
"great persistence in speculating upon the possible distribution of the"
"affections of highly developed modern types."
"The old lady in the antimacassar said, abruptly, \"Ah! you young people,"
"you young people, if you only knew!\" and then laughed and then mused in"
"a marked manner; and the young man with the narrow forehead and glasses"
"cleared his throat and asked the young man in the orange tie whether he"
"believed that Platonic love was possible. Mrs. Goopes said she believed"
"in nothing else, and with that she glanced at Ann Veronica, rose a"
"little abruptly, and directed Goopes and the shy young man in the"
"handing of refreshments."
"But the young man with the orange tie remained in his place, disputing"
"whether the body had not something or other which he called its"
"legitimate claims. And from that they came back by way of the Kreutzer"
"Sonata and Resurrection to Tolstoy again."
"So the talk went on. Goopes, who had at first been a little reserved,"
"resorted presently to the Socratic method to restrain the young man with"
"the orange tie, and bent his forehead over him, and brought out at last"
"very clearly from him that the body was only illusion and everything"
"nothing but just spirit and molecules of thought. It became a sort of"
"duel at last between them, and all the others sat and listened--every"
"one, that is, except the Alderman, who had got the blond young man into"
"a corner by the green-stained dresser with the aluminum things, and was"
"sitting with his back to every one else, holding one hand over his mouth"
"for greater privacy, and telling him, with an accent of confidential"
"admission, in whispers of the chronic struggle between the natural"
"modesty and general inoffensiveness of the Borough Council and the"
"social evil in Marylebone."
"So the talk went on, and presently they were criticising novelists, and"
"certain daring essays of Wilkins got their due share of attention,"
"and then they were discussing the future of the theatre. Ann Veronica"
"intervened a little in the novelist discussion with a defence of Esmond"
"and a denial that the Egoist was obscure, and when she spoke every one"
"else stopped talking and listened. Then they deliberated whether Bernard"
"Shaw ought to go into Parliament. And that brought them to vegetarianism"
"and teetotalism, and the young man in the orange tie and Mrs. Goopes"
"had a great set-to about the sincerity of Chesterton and Belloc that was"
"ended by Goopes showing signs of resuming the Socratic method."
"And at last Ann Veronica and Miss Miniver came down the dark staircase"
"and out into the foggy spaces of the London squares, and crossed Russell"
"Square, Woburn Square, Gordon Square, making an oblique route to Ann"
"Veronica's lodging. They trudged along a little hungry, because of the"
"fruitarian refreshments, and mentally very active. And Miss Miniver fell"
"discussing whether Goopes or Bernard Shaw or Tolstoy or Doctor Tumpany"
"or Wilkins the author had the more powerful and perfect mind in"
"existence at the present time. She was clear there were no other minds"
"like them in all the world."
"Part 4"
"Then one evening Ann Veronica went with Miss Miniver into the back seats"
"of the gallery at Essex Hall, and heard and saw the giant leaders of the"
"Fabian Society who are re-making the world: Bernard Shaw and Toomer and"
"Doctor Tumpany and Wilkins the author, all displayed upon a platform."
"The place was crowded, and the people about her were almost equally"
"made up of very good-looking and enthusiastic young people and a great"
"variety of Goopes-like types. In the discussion there was the oddest"
"mixture of things that were personal and petty with an idealist devotion"
"that was fine beyond dispute. In nearly every speech she heard was the"
"same implication of great and necessary changes in the world--changes"
"to be won by effort and sacrifice indeed, but surely to be won. And"
"afterward she saw a very much larger and more enthusiastic gathering,"
"a meeting of the advanced section of the woman movement in Caxton Hall,"
"where the same note of vast changes in progress sounded; and she went"
"to a soiree of the Dress Reform Association and visited a Food Reform"
"Exhibition, where imminent change was made even alarmingly visible."
"The women's meeting was much more charged with emotional force than the"
"Socialists'. Ann Veronica was carried off her intellectual and critical"
"feet by it altogether, and applauded and uttered cries that subsequent"
"reflection failed to endorse. \"I knew you would feel it,\" said Miss"
"Miniver, as they came away flushed and heated. \"I knew you would begin"
"to see how it all falls into place together.\""
"It did begin to fall into place together. She became more and more"
"alive, not so much to a system of ideas as to a big diffused"
"impulse toward change, to a great discontent with and criticism of"
"life as it is lived, to a clamorous confusion of ideas for"
"reconstruction--reconstruction of the methods of business, of economic"
"development, of the rules of property, of the status of children, of the"
"clothing and feeding and teaching of every one; she developed a quite"
"exaggerated consciousness of a multitude of people going about the"
"swarming spaces of London with their minds full, their talk and gestures"
"full, their very clothing charged with the suggestion of the urgency of"
"this pervasive project of alteration. Some indeed carried themselves,"
"dressed themselves even, rather as foreign visitors from the land"
"of \"Looking Backward\" and \"News from Nowhere\" than as the indigenous"
"Londoners they were. For the most part these were detached people: men"
"practising the plastic arts, young writers, young men in employment, a"
"very large proportion of girls and women--self-supporting women or girls"
"of the student class. They made a stratum into which Ann Veronica was"
"now plunged up to her neck; it had become her stratum."
"None of the things they said and did were altogether new to Ann"
"Veronica, but now she got them massed and alive, instead of by glimpses"
"or in books--alive and articulate and insistent. The London backgrounds,"
"in Bloomsbury and Marylebone, against which these people went to"
"and fro, took on, by reason of their gray facades, their implacably"
"respectable windows and window-blinds, their reiterated unmeaning iron"
"railings, a stronger and stronger suggestion of the flavor of her father"
"at his most obdurate phase, and of all that she felt herself fighting"
"against."
"She was already a little prepared by her discursive reading and"
"discussion under the Widgett influence for ideas and \"movements,\" though"
"temperamentally perhaps she was rather disposed to resist and criticise"
"than embrace them. But the people among whom she was now thrown through"
"the social exertions of Miss Miniver and the Widgetts--for Teddy and"
"Hetty came up from Morningside Park and took her to an eighteen-penny"
"dinner in Soho and introduced her to some art students, who were also"
"Socialists, and so opened the way to an evening of meandering talk in a"
"studio--carried with them like an atmosphere this implication, not only"
"that the world was in some stupid and even obvious way WRONG, with which"
"indeed she was quite prepared to agree, but that it needed only a"
"few pioneers to behave as such and be thoroughly and indiscriminately"
"\"advanced,\" for the new order to achieve itself."
"When ninety per cent. out of the ten or twelve people one meets in a"
"month not only say but feel and assume a thing, it is very hard not"
"to fall into the belief that the thing is so. Imperceptibly almost Ann"
"Veronica began to acquire the new attitude, even while her mind still"
"resisted the felted ideas that went with it. And Miss Miniver began to"
"sway her."
"The very facts that Miss Miniver never stated an argument clearly, that"
"she was never embarrassed by a sense of self-contradiction, and had"
"little more respect for consistency of statement than a washerwoman"
"has for wisps of vapor, which made Ann Veronica critical and hostile at"
"their first encounter in Morningside Park, became at last with constant"
"association the secret of Miss Miniver's growing influence. The brain"
"tires of resistance, and when it meets again and again, incoherently"
"active, the same phrases, the same ideas that it has already slain,"
"exposed and dissected and buried, it becomes less and less energetic to"
"repeat the operation. There must be something, one feels, in ideas that"
"achieve persistently a successful resurrection. What Miss Miniver would"
"have called the Higher Truth supervenes."
"Yet through these talks, these meetings and conferences, these movements"
"and efforts, Ann Veronica, for all that she went with her friend, and"
"at times applauded with her enthusiastically, yet went nevertheless with"
"eyes that grew more and more puzzled, and fine eyebrows more and more"
"disposed to knit. She was with these movements--akin to them, she felt"
"it at times intensely--and yet something eluded her. Morningside Park"
"had been passive and defective; all this rushed about and was active,"
"but it was still defective. It still failed in something. It did seem"
"germane to the matter that so many of the people \"in the van\" were plain"
"people, or faded people, or tired-looking people. It did affect the"
"business that they all argued badly and were egotistical in their"
"manners and inconsistent in their phrases. There were moments when she"
"doubted whether the whole mass of movements and societies and gatherings"
"and talks was not simply one coherent spectacle of failure protecting"
"itself from abjection by the glamour of its own assertions. It happened"
"that at the extremest point of Ann Veronica's social circle from the"
"Widgetts was the family of the Morningside Park horse-dealer, a company"
"of extremely dressy and hilarious young women, with one equestrian"
"brother addicted to fancy waistcoats, cigars, and facial spots. These"
"girls wore hats at remarkable angles and bows to startle and kill; they"
"liked to be right on the spot every time and up to everything that"
"was it from the very beginning and they rendered their conception of"
"Socialists and all reformers by the words \"positively frightening\""
"and \"weird.\" Well, it was beyond dispute that these words did convey"
"a certain quality of the Movements in general amid which Miss Miniver"
"disported herself. They WERE weird. And yet for all that--"
"It got into Ann Veronica's nights at last and kept her awake, the"
"perplexing contrast between the advanced thought and the advanced"
"thinker. The general propositions of Socialism, for example, struck her"
"as admirable, but she certainly did not extend her admiration to any"
"of its exponents. She was still more stirred by the idea of the equal"
"citizenship of men and women, by the realization that a big and growing"
"organization of women were giving form and a generalized expression"
"to just that personal pride, that aspiration for personal freedom and"
"respect which had brought her to London; but when she heard Miss Miniver"
"discoursing on the next step in the suffrage campaign, or read of women"
"badgering Cabinet Ministers, padlocked to railings, or getting up in a"
"public meeting to pipe out a demand for votes and be carried out kicking"
"and screaming, her soul revolted. She could not part with dignity."
"Something as yet unformulated within her kept her estranged from all"
"these practical aspects of her beliefs."
"\"Not for these things, O Ann Veronica, have you revolted,\" it said; \"and"
"this is not your appropriate purpose.\""
"It was as if she faced a darkness in which was something very beautiful"
"and wonderful as yet unimagined. The little pucker in her brows became"
"more perceptible."
"Part 5"
"In the beginning of December Ann Veronica began to speculate privately"
"upon the procedure of pawning. She had decided that she would begin"
"with her pearl necklace. She spent a very disagreeable afternoon and"
"evening--it was raining fast outside, and she had very unwisely left"
"her soundest pair of boots in the boothole of her father's house in"
"Morningside Park--thinking over the economic situation and planning a"
"course of action. Her aunt had secretly sent on to Ann Veronica some new"
"warm underclothing, a dozen pairs of stockings, and her last winter's"
"jacket, but the dear lady had overlooked those boots."
"These things illuminated her situation extremely. Finally she decided"
"upon a step that had always seemed reasonable to her, but that hitherto"
"she had, from motives too faint for her to formulate, refrained from"
"taking. She resolved to go into the City to Ramage and ask for his"
"advice. And next morning she attired herself with especial care and"
"neatness, found his address in the Directory at a post-office, and went"
"to him."
"She had to wait some minutes in an outer office, wherein three young"
"men of spirited costume and appearance regarded her with ill-concealed"
"curiosity and admiration. Then Ramage appeared with effusion, and"
"ushered her into his inner apartment. The three young men exchanged"
"expressive glances."
"The inner apartment was rather gracefully furnished with a thick, fine"
"Turkish carpet, a good brass fender, a fine old bureau, and on the walls"
"were engravings of two young girls' heads by Greuze, and of some modern"
"picture of boys bathing in a sunlit pool."
"\"But this is a surprise!\" said Ramage. \"This is wonderful! I've been"
"feeling that you had vanished from my world. Have you been away from"
"Morningside Park?\""
"\"I'm not interrupting you?\""
"\"You are. Splendidly. Business exists for such interruptions. There you"
"are, the best client's chair.\""
"Ann Veronica sat down, and Ramage's eager eyes feasted on her."
"\"I've been looking out for you,\" he said. \"I confess it.\""
"She had not, she reflected, remembered how prominent his eyes were."
"\"I want some advice,\" said Ann Veronica."
"\"Yes?\""
"\"You remember once, how we talked--at a gate on the Downs? We talked"
"about how a girl might get an independent living.\""
"\"Yes, yes.\""
"\"Well, you see, something has happened at home.\""
"She paused."
"\"Nothing has happened to Mr. Stanley?\""
"\"I've fallen out with my father. It was about--a question of what I"
"might do or might not do. He--In fact, he--he locked me in my room."
"Practically.\""
"Her breath left her for a moment."
"\"I SAY!\" said Mr. Ramage."
"\"I wanted to go to an art-student ball of which he disapproved.\""
"\"And why shouldn't you?\""
"\"I felt that sort of thing couldn't go on. So I packed up and came to"
"London next day.\""
"\"To a friend?\""
"\"To lodgings--alone.\""
"\"I say, you know, you have some pluck. You did it on your own?\""
"Ann Veronica smiled. \"Quite on my own,\" she said."
"\"It's magnificent!\" He leaned back and regarded her with his head a"
"little on one side. \"By Jove!\" he said, \"there is something direct about"
"you. I wonder if I should have locked you up if I'd been your father."
"Luckily I'm not. And you started out forthwith to fight the world and be"
"a citizen on your own basis?\" He came forward again and folded his hands"
"under him on his desk."
"\"How has the world taken it?\" he asked. \"If I was the world I think I"
"should have put down a crimson carpet, and asked you to say what you"
"wanted, and generally walk over me. But the world didn't do that.\""
"\"Not exactly.\""
"\"It presented a large impenetrable back, and went on thinking about"
"something else.\""
"\"It offered from fifteen to two-and-twenty shillings a week--for"
"drudgery.\""
"\"The world has no sense of what is due to youth and courage. It never"
"has had.\""
"\"Yes,\" said Ann Veronica. \"But the thing is, I want a job.\""
"\"Exactly! And so you came along to me. And you see, I don't turn my"
"back, and I am looking at you and thinking about you from top to toe.\""
"\"And what do you think I ought to do?\""
"\"Exactly!\" He lifted a paper-weight and dabbed it gently down again."
"\"What ought you to do?\""
"\"I've hunted up all sorts of things.\""
"\"The point to note is that fundamentally you don't want particularly to"
"do it.\""
"\"I don't understand.\""
"\"You want to be free and so forth, yes. But you don't particularly"
"want to do the job that sets you free--for its own sake. I mean that it"
"doesn't interest you in itself.\""
"\"I suppose not.\""
"\"That's one of our differences. We men are like children. We can get"
"absorbed in play, in games, in the business we do. That's really why"
"we do them sometimes rather well and get on. But women--women as a rule"
"don't throw themselves into things like that. As a matter of fact it"
"isn't their affair. And as a natural consequence, they don't do so well,"
"and they don't get on--and so the world doesn't pay them. They don't"
"catch on to discursive interests, you see, because they are more"
"serious, they are concentrated on the central reality of life, and a"
"little impatient of its--its outer aspects. At least that, I think, is"
"what makes a clever woman's independent career so much more difficult"
"than a clever man's.\""
"\"She doesn't develop a specialty.\" Ann Veronica was doing her best to"
"follow him."
"\"She has one, that's why. Her specialty is the central thing in life, it"
"is life itself, the warmth of life, sex--and love.\""
"He pronounced this with an air of profound conviction and with his"
"eyes on Ann Veronica's face. He had an air of having told her a deep,"
"personal secret. She winced as he thrust the fact at her, was about to"
"answer, and checked herself. She colored faintly."
"\"That doesn't touch the question I asked you,\" she said. \"It may be"
"true, but it isn't quite what I have in mind.\""
"\"Of course not,\" said Ramage, as one who rouses himself from deep"
"preoccupations And he began to question her in a business-like way upon"
"the steps she had taken and the inquiries she had made. He displayed"
"none of the airy optimism of their previous talk over the downland gate."
"He was helpful, but gravely dubious. \"You see,\" he said, \"from my point"
"of view you're grown up--you're as old as all the goddesses and the"
"contemporary of any man alive. But from the--the economic point of view"
"you're a very young and altogether inexperienced person.\""
"He returned to and developed that idea. \"You're still,\" he said, \"in the"
"educational years. From the point of view of most things in the world"
"of employment which a woman can do reasonably well and earn a living"
"by, you're unripe and half-educated. If you had taken your degree, for"
"example.\""
"He spoke of secretarial work, but even there she would need to be able"
"to do typing and shorthand. He made it more and more evident to her that"
"her proper course was not to earn a salary but to accumulate equipment."
"\"You see,\" he said, \"you are like an inaccessible gold-mine in all this"
"sort of matter. You're splendid stuff, you know, but you've got nothing"
"ready to sell. That's the flat business situation.\""
"He thought. Then he slapped his hand on his desk and looked up with"
"the air of a man struck by a brilliant idea. \"Look here,\" he said,"
"protruding his eyes; \"why get anything to do at all just yet? Why, if"
"you must be free, why not do the sensible thing? Make yourself worth"
"a decent freedom. Go on with your studies at the Imperial College,"
"for example, get a degree, and make yourself good value. Or become a"
"thorough-going typist and stenographer and secretarial expert.\""
"\"But I can't do that.\""
"\"Why not?\""
"\"You see, if I do go home my father objects to the College, and as for"
"typing--\""
"\"Don't go home.\""
"\"Yes, but you forget; how am I to live?\""
"\"Easily. Easily.... Borrow.... From me.\""
"\"I couldn't do that,\" said Ann Veronica, sharply."
"\"I see no reason why you shouldn't.\""
"\"It's impossible.\""
"\"As one friend to another. Men are always doing it, and if you set up to"
"be a man--\""
"\"No, it's absolutely out of the question, Mr. Ramage.\" And Ann"
"Veronica's face was hot."
"Ramage pursed his rather loose lips and shrugged his shoulders, with"
"his eyes fixed steadily upon her. \"Well anyhow--I don't see the force of"
"your objection, you know. That's my advice to you. Here I am. Consider"
"you've got resources deposited with me. Perhaps at the first blush--it"
"strikes you as odd. People are brought up to be so shy about money. As"
"though it was indelicate--it's just a sort of shyness. But here I am to"
"draw upon. Here I am as an alternative either to nasty work--or going"
"home.\""
"\"It's very kind of you--\" began Ann Veronica."
"\"Not a bit. Just a friendly polite suggestion. I don't suggest any"
"philanthropy. I shall charge you five per cent., you know, fair and"
"square.\""
"Ann Veronica opened her lips quickly and did not speak. But the five per"
"cent. certainly did seem to improve the aspect of Ramage's suggestion."
"\"Well, anyhow, consider it open.\" He dabbed with his paper-weight again,"
"and spoke in an entirely indifferent tone. \"And now tell me, please, how"
"you eloped from Morningside Park. How did you get your luggage out of"
"the house? Wasn't it--wasn't it rather in some respects--rather a lark?"
"It's one of my regrets for my lost youth. I never ran away from anywhere"
"with anybody anywhen. And now--I suppose I should be considered too"
"old. I don't feel it.... Didn't you feel rather EVENTFUL--in the"
"train--coming up to Waterloo?\""
"Part 6"
"Before Christmas Ann Veronica had gone to Ramage again and accepted this"
"offer she had at first declined."
"Many little things had contributed to that decision. The chief influence"
"was her awakening sense of the need of money. She had been forced to buy"
"herself that pair of boots and a walking-skirt, and the pearl necklace"
"at the pawnbrokers' had yielded very disappointingly. And, also, she"
"wanted to borrow that money. It did seem in so many ways exactly what"
"Ramage said it was--the sensible thing to do. There it was--to be"
"borrowed. It would put the whole adventure on a broader and better"
"footing; it seemed, indeed, almost the only possible way in which she"
"might emerge from her rebellion with anything like success. If only for"
"the sake of her argument with her home, she wanted success. And why,"
"after all, should she not borrow money from Ramage?"
"It was so true what he said; middle-class people WERE ridiculously"
"squeamish about money. Why should they be?"
"She and Ramage were friends, very good friends. If she was in a position"
"to help him she would help him; only it happened to be the other way"
"round. He was in a position to help her. What was the objection?"
"She found it impossible to look her own diffidence in the face. So she"
"went to Ramage and came to the point almost at once."
"\"Can you spare me forty pounds?\" she said."
"Mr. Ramage controlled his expression and thought very quickly."
"\"Agreed,\" he said, \"certainly,\" and drew a checkbook toward him."
"\"It's best,\" he said, \"to make it a good round sum."
"\"I won't give you a check though--Yes, I will. I'll give you an"
"uncrossed check, and then you can get it at the bank here, quite close"
"by.... You'd better not have all the money on you; you had better"
"open a small account in the post-office and draw it out a fiver at a"
"time. That won't involve references, as a bank account would--and all"
"that sort of thing. The money will last longer, and--it won't bother"
"you.\""
"He stood up rather close to her and looked into her eyes. He seemed to"
"be trying to understand something very perplexing and elusive. \"It's"
"jolly,\" he said, \"to feel you have come to me. It's a sort of guarantee"
"of confidence. Last time--you made me feel snubbed.\""
"He hesitated, and went off at a tangent. \"There's no end of things I'd"
"like to talk over with you. It's just upon my lunch-time. Come and have"
"lunch with me.\""
"Ann Veronica fenced for a moment. \"I don't want to take up your time.\""
"\"We won't go to any of these City places. They're just all men, and no"
"one is safe from scandal. But I know a little place where we'll get a"
"little quiet talk.\""
"Ann Veronica for some indefinable reason did not want to lunch with him,"
"a reason indeed so indefinable that she dismissed it, and Ramage went"
"through the outer office with her, alert and attentive, to the vivid"
"interest of the three clerks. The three clerks fought for the only"
"window, and saw her whisked into a hansom. Their subsequent conversation"
"is outside the scope of our story."
"\"Ritter's!\" said Ramage to the driver, \"Dean Street.\""
"It was rare that Ann Veronica used hansoms, and to be in one was itself"
"eventful and exhilarating. She liked the high, easy swing of the thing"
"over its big wheels, the quick clatter-patter of the horse, the passage"
"of the teeming streets. She admitted her pleasure to Ramage."
"And Ritter's, too, was very amusing and foreign and discreet; a little"
"rambling room with a number of small tables, with red electric light"
"shades and flowers. It was an overcast day, albeit not foggy, and"
"the electric light shades glowed warmly, and an Italian waiter with"
"insufficient English took Ramage's orders, and waited with an appearance"
"of affection. Ann Veronica thought the whole affair rather jolly. Ritter"
"sold better food than most of his compatriots, and cooked it better, and"
"Ramage, with a fine perception of a feminine palate, ordered Vero Capri."
"It was, Ann Veronica felt, as a sip or so of that remarkable blend"
"warmed her blood, just the sort of thing that her aunt would not"
"approve, to be lunching thus, tete-a-tete with a man; and yet at the"
"same time it was a perfectly innocent as well as agreeable proceeding."
"They talked across their meal in an easy and friendly manner about Ann"
"Veronica's affairs. He was really very bright and clever, with a sort of"
"conversational boldness that was just within the limits of permissible"
"daring. She described the Goopes and the Fabians to him, and gave him"
"a sketch of her landlady; and he talked in the most liberal and"
"entertaining way of a modern young woman's outlook. He seemed to know"
"a great deal about life. He gave glimpses of possibilities. He roused"
"curiosities. He contrasted wonderfully with the empty showing-off of"
"Teddy. His friendship seemed a thing worth having...."
"But when she was thinking it over in her room that evening vague and"
"baffling doubts came drifting across this conviction. She doubted how"
"she stood toward him and what the restrained gleam of his face might"
"signify. She felt that perhaps, in her desire to play an adequate part"
"in the conversation, she had talked rather more freely than she ought to"
"have done, and given him a wrong impression of herself."
"Part 7"
"That was two days before Christmas Eve. The next morning came a compact"
"letter from her father."
"\"MY DEAR DAUGHTER,\" it ran,--\"Here, on the verge of the season"
"of forgiveness I hold out a last hand to you in the hope of a"
"reconciliation. I ask you, although it is not my place to ask you, to"
"return home. This roof is still open to you. You will not be taunted"
"if you return and everything that can be done will be done to make you"
"happy."
"\"Indeed, I must implore you to return. This adventure of yours has gone"
"on altogether too long; it has become a serious distress to both your"
"aunt and myself. We fail altogether to understand your motives in doing"
"what you are doing, or, indeed, how you are managing to do it, or what"
"you are managing on. If you will think only of one trifling aspect--the"
"inconvenience it must be to us to explain your absence--I think you may"
"begin to realize what it all means for us. I need hardly say that your"
"aunt joins with me very heartily in this request."
"\"Please come home. You will not find me unreasonable with you."
"\"Your affectionate"
"\"FATHER.\""
"Ann Veronica sat over her fire with her father's note in her hand."
"\"Queer letters he writes,\" she said. \"I suppose most people's letters"
"are queer. Roof open--like a Noah's Ark. I wonder if he really wants me"
"to go home. It's odd how little I know of him, and of how he feels and"
"what he feels.\""
"\"I wonder how he treated Gwen.\""
"Her mind drifted into a speculation about her sister. \"I ought to look"
"up Gwen,\" she said. \"I wonder what happened.\""
"Then she fell to thinking about her aunt. \"I would like to go home,\" she"
"cried, \"to please her. She has been a dear. Considering how little he"
"lets her have.\""
"The truth prevailed. \"The unaccountable thing is that I wouldn't go home"
"to please her. She is, in her way, a dear. One OUGHT to want to please"
"her. And I don't. I don't care. I can't even make myself care.\""
"Presently, as if for comparison with her father's letter, she got out"
"Ramage's check from the box that contained her papers. For so far she"
"had kept it uncashed. She had not even endorsed it."
"\"Suppose I chuck it,\" she remarked, standing with the mauve slip in her"
"hand--\"suppose I chuck it, and surrender and go home! Perhaps, after"
"all, Roddy was right!"
"\"Father keeps opening the door and shutting it, but a time will come--"
"\"I could still go home!\""
"She held Ramage's check as if to tear it across. \"No,\" she said at last;"
"\"I'm a human being--not a timid female. What could I do at home? The"
"other's a crumple-up--just surrender. Funk! I'll see it out.\""
"CHAPTER THE EIGHTH"
"BIOLOGY"
"Part 1"
"January found Ann Veronica a student in the biological laboratory of the"
"Central Imperial College that towers up from among the back streets in"
"the angle between Euston Road and Great Portland Street. She was working"
"very steadily at the Advanced Course in Comparative Anatomy, wonderfully"
"relieved to have her mind engaged upon one methodically developing theme"
"in the place of the discursive uncertainties of the previous two months,"
"and doing her utmost to keep right in the back of her mind and out"
"of sight the facts, firstly, that she had achieved this haven of"
"satisfactory activity by incurring a debt to Ramage of forty pounds,"
"and, secondly, that her present position was necessarily temporary and"
"her outlook quite uncertain."
"The biological laboratory had an atmosphere that was all its own."
"It was at the top of the building, and looked clear over a clustering"
"mass of inferior buildings toward Regent's Park. It was long and narrow,"
"a well-lit, well-ventilated, quiet gallery of small tables and sinks,"
"pervaded by a thin smell of methylated spirit and of a mitigated"
"and sterilized organic decay. Along the inner side was a wonderfully"
"arranged series of displayed specimens that Russell himself had"
"prepared. The supreme effect for Ann Veronica was its surpassing"
"relevance; it made every other atmosphere she knew seem discursive and"
"confused. The whole place and everything in it aimed at one thing--to"
"illustrate, to elaborate, to criticise and illuminate, and make ever"
"plainer and plainer the significance of animal and vegetable structure."
"It dealt from floor to ceiling and end to end with the Theory of the"
"Forms of Life; the very duster by the blackboard was there to do its"
"share in that work, the very washers in the taps; the room was more"
"simply concentrated in aim even than a church. To that, perhaps, a"
"large part of its satisfyingness was due. Contrasted with the confused"
"movement and presences of a Fabian meeting, or the inexplicable"
"enthusiasm behind the suffrage demand, with the speeches that were"
"partly egotistical displays, partly artful manoeuvres, and partly"
"incoherent cries for unsoundly formulated ends, compared with the"
"comings and goings of audiences and supporters that were like the"
"eddy-driven drift of paper in the street, this long, quiet, methodical"
"chamber shone like a star seen through clouds."
"Day after day for a measured hour in the lecture-theatre, with elaborate"
"power and patience, Russell pieced together difficulty and suggestion,"
"instance and counter-instance, in the elaborate construction of the"
"family tree of life. And then the students went into the long laboratory"
"and followed out these facts in almost living tissue with microscope and"
"scalpel, probe and microtome, and the utmost of their skill and care,"
"making now and then a raid into the compact museum of illustration next"
"door, in which specimens and models and directions stood in disciplined"
"ranks, under the direction of the demonstrator Capes. There was a couple"
"of blackboards at each end of the aisle of tables, and at these Capes,"
"with quick and nervous speech that contrasted vividly with Russell's"
"slow, definitive articulation, directed the dissection and made"
"illuminating comments on the structures under examination. Then he"
"would come along the laboratory, sitting down by each student in"
"turn, checking the work and discussing its difficulties, and answering"
"questions arising out of Russell's lecture."
"Ann Veronica had come to the Imperial College obsessed by the"
"great figure of Russell, by the part he had played in the Darwinian"
"controversies, and by the resolute effect of the grim-lipped, yellow,"
"leonine face beneath the mane of silvery hair. Capes was rather a"
"discovery. Capes was something superadded. Russell burned like a beacon,"
"but Capes illuminated by darting flashes and threw light, even if it"
"was but momentary light, into a hundred corners that Russell left"
"steadfastly in the shade."
"Capes was an exceptionally fair man of two or three-and-thirty, so"
"ruddily blond that it was a mercy he had escaped light eyelashes, and"
"with a minor but by no means contemptible reputation of his own. He"
"talked at the blackboard in a pleasant, very slightly lisping voice with"
"a curious spontaneity, and was sometimes very clumsy in his exposition,"
"and sometimes very vivid. He dissected rather awkwardly and hurriedly,"
"but, on the whole, effectively, and drew with an impatient directness"
"that made up in significance what it lacked in precision. Across the"
"blackboard the colored chalks flew like flights of variously tinted"
"rockets as diagram after diagram flickered into being."
"There happened that year to be an unusual proportion of girls and women"
"in the advanced laboratory, perhaps because the class as a whole was an"
"exceptionally small one. It numbered nine, and four of these were women"
"students. As a consequence of its small size, it was possible to get"
"along with the work on a much easier and more colloquial footing than"
"a larger class would have permitted. And a custom had grown up of a"
"general tea at four o'clock, under the auspices of a Miss Garvice, a"
"tall and graceful girl of distinguished intellectual incompetence, in"
"whom the hostess instinct seemed to be abnormally developed."
"Capes would come to these teas; he evidently liked to come, and he"
"would appear in the doorway of the preparation-room, a pleasing note of"
"shyness in his manner, hovering for an invitation."
"From the first, Ann Veronica found him an exceptionally interesting man."
"To begin with, he struck her as being the most variable person she had"
"ever encountered. At times he was brilliant and masterful, talked round"
"and over every one, and would have been domineering if he had not"
"been extraordinarily kindly; at times he was almost monosyllabic, and"
"defeated Miss Garvice's most skilful attempts to draw him out. Sometimes"
"he was obviously irritable and uncomfortable and unfortunate in his"
"efforts to seem at ease. And sometimes he overflowed with a peculiarly"
"malignant wit that played, with devastating effect, upon any topics that"
"had the courage to face it. Ann Veronica's experiences of men had been"
"among more stable types--Teddy, who was always absurd; her father,"
"who was always authoritative and sentimental; Manning, who was always"
"Manning. And most of the others she had met had, she felt, the same"
"steadfastness. Goopes, she was sure was always high-browed and slow and"
"Socratic. And Ramage too--about Ramage there would always be that air of"
"avidity, that air of knowledge and inquiry, the mixture of things in his"
"talk that were rather good with things that were rather poor. But one"
"could not count with any confidence upon Capes."
"The five men students were a mixed company. There was a very white-faced"
"youngster of eighteen who brushed back his hair exactly in Russell's"
"manner, and was disposed to be uncomfortably silent when he was"
"near her, and to whom she felt it was only Christian kindness to be"
"consistently pleasant; and a lax young man of five-and-twenty in navy"
"blue, who mingled Marx and Bebel with the more orthodox gods of the"
"biological pantheon. There was a short, red-faced, resolute youth who"
"inherited an authoritative attitude upon bacteriology from his father;"
"a Japanese student of unassuming manners who drew beautifully and had"
"an imperfect knowledge of English; and a dark, unwashed Scotchman"
"with complicated spectacles, who would come every morning as a sort of"
"volunteer supplementary demonstrator, look very closely at her work"
"and her, tell her that her dissections were \"fairish,\" or \"very fairish"
"indeed,\" or \"high above the normal female standard,\" hover as if for"
"some outbreak of passionate gratitude and with admiring retrospects"
"that made the facetted spectacles gleam like diamonds, return to his own"
"place."
"The women, Ann Veronica thought, were not quite so interesting as the"
"men. There were two school-mistresses, one of whom--Miss Klegg--might"
"have been a first cousin to Miss Miniver, she had so many Miniver"
"traits; there was a preoccupied girl whose name Ann Veronica never"
"learned, but who worked remarkably well; and Miss Garvice, who began"
"by attracting her very greatly--she moved so beautifully--and ended by"
"giving her the impression that moving beautifully was the beginning and"
"end of her being."
"Part 2"
"The next few weeks were a time of the very liveliest thought and growth"
"for Ann Veronica. The crowding impressions of the previous weeks seemed"
"to run together directly her mind left the chaotic search for employment"
"and came into touch again with a coherent and systematic development"
"of ideas. The advanced work at the Central Imperial College was in the"
"closest touch with living interests and current controversies; it drew"
"its illustrations and material from Russell's two great researches--upon"
"the relation of the brachiopods to the echinodermata, and upon the"
"secondary and tertiary mammalian and pseudo-mammalian factors in the"
"free larval forms of various marine organisms. Moreover, a vigorous fire"
"of mutual criticism was going on now between the Imperial College and"
"the Cambridge Mendelians and echoed in the lectures. From beginning to"
"end it was first-hand stuff."
"But the influence of the science radiated far beyond its own special"
"field--beyond those beautiful but highly technical problems with which"
"we do not propose for a moment to trouble the naturally terrified"
"reader. Biology is an extraordinarily digestive science. It throws out a"
"number of broad experimental generalizations, and then sets out to"
"bring into harmony or relation with these an infinitely multifarious"
"collection of phenomena. The little streaks upon the germinating area"
"of an egg, the nervous movements of an impatient horse, the trick of"
"a calculating boy, the senses of a fish, the fungus at the root of a"
"garden flower, and the slime upon a sea-wet rock--ten thousand such"
"things bear their witness and are illuminated. And not only did these"
"tentacular generalizations gather all the facts of natural history and"
"comparative anatomy together, but they seemed always stretching out"
"further and further into a world of interests that lay altogether"
"outside their legitimate bounds."
"It came to Ann Veronica one night after a long talk with Miss Miniver,"
"as a sudden remarkable thing, as a grotesque, novel aspect, that this"
"slowly elaborating biological scheme had something more than an academic"
"interest for herself. And not only so, but that it was after all, a more"
"systematic and particular method of examining just the same questions"
"that underlay the discussions of the Fabian Society, the talk of the"
"West Central Arts Club, the chatter of the studios and the deep, the"
"bottomless discussions of the simple-life homes. It was the same Bios"
"whose nature and drift and ways and methods and aspects engaged"
"them all. And she, she in her own person too, was this eternal Bios,"
"beginning again its recurrent journey to selection and multiplication"
"and failure or survival."
"But this was but a momentary gleam of personal application, and at this"
"time she followed it up no further."
"And now Ann Veronica's evenings were also becoming very busy. She"
"pursued her interest in the Socialist movement and in the Suffragist"
"agitation in the company of Miss Miniver. They went to various central"
"and local Fabian gatherings, and to a number of suffrage meetings. Teddy"
"Widgett hovered on the fringe of all these gatherings, blinking at Ann"
"Veronica and occasionally making a wildly friendly dash at her, and"
"carrying her and Miss Miniver off to drink cocoa with a choice diversity"
"of other youthful and congenial Fabians after the meetings. Then Mr."
"Manning loomed up ever and again into her world, full of a futile"
"solicitude, and almost always declaring she was splendid, splendid, and"
"wishing he could talk things out with her. Teas he contributed to the"
"commissariat of Ann Veronica's campaign--quite a number of teas. He"
"would get her to come to tea with him, usually in a pleasant tea-room"
"over a fruit-shop in Tottenham Court Road, and he would discuss his own"
"point of view and hint at a thousand devotions were she but to command"
"him. And he would express various artistic sensibilities and aesthetic"
"appreciations in carefully punctuated sentences and a large, clear"
"voice. At Christmas he gave her a set of a small edition of Meredith's"
"novels, very prettily bound in flexible leather, being guided in the"
"choice of an author, as he intimated, rather by her preferences than his"
"own."
"There was something markedly and deliberately liberal-minded in his"
"manner in all their encounters. He conveyed not only his sense of the"
"extreme want of correctitude in their unsanctioned meetings, but also"
"that, so far as he was concerned, this irregularity mattered not at"
"all, that he had flung--and kept on flinging--such considerations to the"
"wind."
"And, in addition, she was now seeing and talking to Ramage almost"
"weekly, on a theory which she took very gravely, that they were"
"exceptionally friends. He would ask her to come to dinner with him in"
"some little Italian or semi-Bohemian restaurant in the district toward"
"Soho, or in one of the more stylish and magnificent establishments about"
"Piccadilly Circus, and for the most part she did not care to refuse."
"Nor, indeed, did she want to refuse. These dinners, from their lavish"
"display of ambiguous hors d'oeuvre to their skimpy ices in dishes of"
"frilled paper, with their Chianti flasks and Parmesan dishes and their"
"polyglot waiters and polyglot clientele, were very funny and bright;"
"and she really liked Ramage, and valued his help and advice. It was"
"interesting to see how different and characteristic his mode of approach"
"was to all sorts of questions that interested her, and it was amusing to"
"discover this other side to the life of a Morningside Park inhabitant."
"She had thought that all Morningside Park householders came home before"
"seven at the latest, as her father usually did. Ramage talked always"
"about women or some woman's concern, and very much about Ann Veronica's"
"own outlook upon life. He was always drawing contrasts between a woman's"
"lot and a man's, and treating her as a wonderful new departure in this"
"comparison. Ann Veronica liked their relationship all the more because"
"it was an unusual one."
"After these dinners they would have a walk, usually to the Thames"
"Embankment to see the two sweeps of river on either side of Waterloo"
"Bridge; and then they would part at Westminster Bridge, perhaps, and"
"he would go on to Waterloo. Once he suggested they should go to a"
"music-hall and see a wonderful new dancer, but Ann Veronica did not feel"
"she cared to see a new dancer. So, instead, they talked of dancing"
"and what it might mean in a human life. Ann Veronica thought it was"
"a spontaneous release of energy expressive of well-being, but Ramage"
"thought that by dancing, men, and such birds and animals as dance, come"
"to feel and think of their bodies."
"This intercourse, which had been planned to warm Ann Veronica to a"
"familiar affection with Ramage, was certainly warming Ramage to a"
"constantly deepening interest in Ann Veronica. He felt that he was"
"getting on with her very slowly indeed, but he did not see how he could"
"get on faster. He had, he felt, to create certain ideas and vivify"
"certain curiosities and feelings in her. Until that was done a certain"
"experience of life assured him that a girl is a locked coldness against"
"a man's approach. She had all the fascination of being absolutely"
"perplexing in this respect. On the one hand, she seemed to think plainly"
"and simply, and would talk serenely and freely about topics that most"
"women have been trained either to avoid or conceal; and on the other she"
"was unconscious, or else she had an air of being unconscious--that was"
"the riddle--to all sorts of personal applications that almost any girl"
"or woman, one might have thought, would have made. He was always doing"
"his best to call her attention to the fact that he was a man of spirit"
"and quality and experience, and she a young and beautiful woman, and"
"that all sorts of constructions upon their relationship were possible,"
"trusting her to go on from that to the idea that all sorts of"
"relationships were possible. She responded with an unfaltering"
"appearance of insensibility, and never as a young and beautiful woman"
"conscious of sex; always in the character of an intelligent girl"
"student."
"His perception of her personal beauty deepened and quickened with each"
"encounter. Every now and then her general presence became radiantly"
"dazzling in his eyes; she would appear in the street coming toward him,"
"a surprise, so fine and smiling and welcoming was she, so expanded and"
"illuminated and living, in contrast with his mere expectation. Or he"
"would find something--a wave in her hair, a little line in the contour"
"of her brow or neck, that made an exquisite discovery."
"He was beginning to think about her inordinately. He would sit in"
"his inner office and compose conversations with her, penetrating,"
"illuminating, and nearly conclusive--conversations that never proved to"
"be of the slightest use at all with her when he met her face to face."
"And he began also at times to wake at night and think about her."
"He thought of her and himself, and no longer in that vein of incidental"
"adventure in which he had begun. He thought, too, of the fretful invalid"
"who lay in the next room to his, whose money had created his business"
"and made his position in the world."
"\"I've had most of the things I wanted,\" said Ramage, in the stillness of"
"the night."
"Part 3"
"For a time Ann Veronica's family had desisted from direct offers of a"
"free pardon; they were evidently waiting for her resources to come to"
"an end. Neither father, aunt, nor brothers made a sign, and then"
"one afternoon in early February her aunt came up in a state between"
"expostulation and dignified resentment, but obviously very anxious for"
"Ann Veronica's welfare. \"I had a dream in the night,\" she said. \"I saw"
"you in a sort of sloping, slippery place, holding on by your hands and"
"slipping. You seemed to me to be slipping and slipping, and your face"
"was white. It was really most vivid, most vivid! You seemed to be"
"slipping and just going to tumble and holding on. It made me wake up,"
"and there I lay thinking of you, spending your nights up here all alone,"
"and no one to look after you. I wondered what you could be doing and"
"what might be happening to you. I said to myself at once, 'Either this"
"is a coincidence or the caper sauce.' But I made sure it was you. I felt"
"I MUST do something anyhow, and up I came just as soon as I could to see"
"you.\""
"She had spoken rather rapidly. \"I can't help saying it,\" she said, with"
"the quality of her voice altering, \"but I do NOT think it is right for"
"an unprotected girl to be in London alone as you are.\""
"\"But I'm quite equal to taking care of myself, aunt.\""
"\"It must be most uncomfortable here. It is most uncomfortable for every"
"one concerned.\""
"She spoke with a certain asperity. She felt that Ann Veronica had duped"
"her in that dream, and now that she had come up to London she might as"
"well speak her mind."
"\"No Christmas dinner,\" she said, \"or anything nice! One doesn't even"
"know what you are doing.\""
"\"I'm going on working for my degree.\""
"\"Why couldn't you do that at home?\""
"\"I'm working at the Imperial College. You see, aunt, it's the only"
"possible way for me to get a good degree in my subjects, and father"
"won't hear of it. There'd only be endless rows if I was at home. And how"
"could I come home--when he locks me in rooms and all that?\""
"\"I do wish this wasn't going on,\" said Miss Stanley, after a pause. \"I"
"do wish you and your father could come to some agreement.\""
"Ann Veronica responded with conviction: \"I wish so, too.\""
"\"Can't we arrange something? Can't we make a sort of treaty?\""
"\"He wouldn't keep it. He would get very cross one evening and no one"
"would dare to remind him of it.\""
